AGUECHEEK	1	3	154	154	1	8	Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	156	156	1	4	Bless you, fair shrew.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	159	159	1	2	What’s that?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	161	162	2	7	Good Mistress Accost, I desire better<br>acquaintance.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	164	164	1	4	Good Mistress Mary Accost—
AGUECHEEK	1	3	167	168	2	17	By my troth, I would not undertake her in<br>this company. Is that the meaning of <span class="quote" data-words="1">accost</span>?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	172	174	3	23	An you part so, mistress, I would I might<br>never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you<br>have fools in hand?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	176	177	2	9	Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my<br>hand.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	181	182	2	5	Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your<br>metaphor?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	184	185	2	21	Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I<br>can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	187	187	1	5	Are you full of them?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	192	196	5	45	Never in your life, I think, unless you see<br>canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have<br>no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man<br>has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that<br>does harm to my wit.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	198	199	2	13	An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride<br>home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	201	204	4	32	What is <span class="quote" data-words="1"><span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="fr">pourquoi</span></span>? Do, or not do? I would I<br>had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in<br>fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but<br>followed the arts!
AGUECHEEK	1	3	206	206	1	7	Why, would that have mended my hair?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	209	209	1	9	But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	213	216	4	32	Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your<br>niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one<br>she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by<br>woos her.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	220	222	3	24	I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’<br>strangest mind i’ th’ world. I delight in masques<br>and revels sometimes altogether.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	224	226	3	24	As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,<br>under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not<br>compare with an old man.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	228	228	1	6	Faith, I can cut a caper.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	230	231	2	15	And I think I have the back-trick simply as<br>strong as any man in Illyria.
AGUECHEEK	1	3	241	243	3	18	Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a<br>dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some<br>revels?
AGUECHEEK	1	3	246	246	1	5	Taurus? That’s sides and heart.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	705	706	2	19	Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to<br>be up late is to be up late.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	712	713	2	14	Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists<br>of eating and drinking.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	716	716	1	6	Here comes the Fool, i’ faith.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	720	727	8	68	By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.<br>I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,<br>and so sweet a breath to sing, as the Fool has.—In<br>sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night<br>when thou spok’st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians<br>passing the equinoctial of Queubus. ’Twas very<br>good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.<br>Hadst it?
AGUECHEEK	2	3	731	732	2	14	Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when<br>all is done. Now, a song!
AGUECHEEK	2	3	735	736	2	11	There’s a testril of<br>me, too. If one knight give a—
AGUECHEEK	2	3	740	740	1	8	Ay, ay, I care not for good life.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	747	747	1	4	Excellent good, i’ faith!
AGUECHEEK	2	3	755	755	1	8	A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	757	757	1	6	Very sweet and contagious, i’ faith.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	762	763	2	13	An you love me, let’s do ’t. I am dog at a<br>catch.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	765	765	2	8	Most certain. Let our catch be <span class="quote" data-words="2">ThouKnave.</span>
AGUECHEEK	2	3	769	770	3	20	’Tis not the first time I have constrained one<br>to call me <span class="quote" data-words="1">knave.</span> Begin, Fool. It begins <span class="quote" data-words="3">Holdthy peace.</span>
AGUECHEEK	2	3	773	773	1	5	Good, i’ faith. Come, begin.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	783	785	3	27	Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,<br>and so do I, too. He does it with a better grace, but<br>I do it more natural.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	826	829	4	30	’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a<br>man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and<br>then to break promise with him and make a fool of<br>him.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	841	841	1	11	O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!
AGUECHEEK	2	3	844	845	2	13	I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have<br>reason good enough.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	863	863	1	7	I have ’t in my nose, too.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	868	868	1	9	And your horse now would make him an ass.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	870	870	1	4	O, ’twill be admirable!
AGUECHEEK	2	3	877	877	1	6	Before me, she’s a good wench.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	880	880	1	5	I was adored once, too.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	883	884	2	12	If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way<br>out.
AGUECHEEK	2	3	887	888	2	12	If I do not, never trust me, take it how you<br>will.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1038	1038	1	10	An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1059	1059	1	7	’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1063	1063	1	4	Pistol him, pistol him!
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1067	1067	1	4	Fie on him, Jezebel!
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1106	1106	1	5	That’s me, I warrant you.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1108	1109	2	10	I knew ’twas I, for many do call me<br>fool.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1119	1119	1	9	Her c’s, her u’s, and her t’s. Why that?
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1214	1214	1	4	So could I too.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1217	1217	1	3	Nor I neither.
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1220	1220	1	4	Or o’ mine either?
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1223	1223	1	5	I’ faith, or I either?
AGUECHEEK	2	5	1239	1239	1	4	I’ll make one, too.
AGUECHEEK	3	1	1311	1311	1	4	<span class="foreign" data-words="4" data-lang="fr">Dieu vous garde, monsieur.</span>
AGUECHEEK	3	1	1313	1313	1	9	I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.
AGUECHEEK	3	1	1327	1327	2	8	That youth’s a rare courtier. <span class="quote" data-words="2">Rainodors,</span> well.
AGUECHEEK	3	1	1331	1332	2	11	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Odors,</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">pregnant,</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">vouchsafed.</span><br>I’ll get ’em all three all ready.
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1412	1412	1	8	No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1415	1417	3	24	Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the<br>Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon<br>me. I saw ’t i’ th’ orchard.
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1420	1420	1	7	As plain as I see you now.
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1423	1423	1	8	’Slight, will you make an ass o’ me?
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1441	1443	3	24	An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for<br>policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a<br>politician.
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1451	1451	1	10	Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
AGUECHEEK	3	2	1461	1461	1	5	Where shall I find you?
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1699	1700	2	13	Here’s the challenge.<br>Read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1702	1702	1	9	Ay, is ’t. I warrant him. Do but read.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1738	1738	1	6	Nay, let me alone for swearing.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1838	1838	1	8	Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1841	1845	5	39	Plague on ’t! An I thought he had been<br>valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him<br>damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let<br>the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray<br>Capilet.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1870	1871	2	6	Pray God he keep his<br>oath!
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1884	1886	3	25	Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised<br>you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you<br>easily, and reins well.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1958	1958	1	8	’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.
AGUECHEEK	3	4	1961	1961	1	4	An I do not—
AGUECHEEK	4	1	1987	1988	2	10	Now, sir, have I met you again?<br>There’s for you.
AGUECHEEK	4	1	1996	1999	4	38	Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to<br>work with him. I’ll have an action of battery against<br>him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck<br>him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2385	2386	2	13	For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one<br>presently to Sir Toby.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2388	2391	4	31	Has broke my head across, and has given Sir<br>Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,<br>your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at<br>home.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2393	2395	3	17	The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took<br>him for a coward, but he’s the very devil<br>incardinate.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2397	2399	3	26	’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my<br>head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to<br>do ’t by Sir Toby.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2403	2407	5	52	If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt<br>me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.<br>Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear<br>more. But if he had not been in drink, he would<br>have tickled you othergates than he did.
AGUECHEEK	5	1	2417	2418	2	10	I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be<br>dressed together.
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	614	615	2	14	Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that<br>I go with you?
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	621	622	2	10	Let me yet know of you whither you are<br>bound.
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	636	636	1	3	Alas the day!
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	645	645	1	6	Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	647	648	2	14	If you will not murder me for my love, let me<br>be your servant.
ANTONIO-TN	2	1	656	660	5	42	The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!<br>I have many enemies in Orsino’s court,<br>Else would I very shortly see thee there.<br>But come what may, I do adore thee so<br>That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1497	1506	10	75	I could not stay behind you. My desire,<br>More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth;<br>And not all love to see you, though so much<br>As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,<br>But jealousy what might befall your travel,<br>Being skill-less in these parts, which to a stranger,<br>Unguided and unfriended, often prove<br>Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,<br>The rather by these arguments of fear,<br>Set forth in your pursuit.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1514	1514	1	8	Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1519	1523	5	40	Would you’d pardon me.<br>I do not without danger walk these streets.<br>Once in a sea fight ’gainst the Count his galleys<br>I did some service, of such note indeed<br>That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1525	1532	8	63	Th’ offense is not of such a bloody nature,<br>Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel<br>Might well have given us bloody argument.<br>It might have since been answered in repaying<br>What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake,<br>Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,<br>For which, if I be lapsèd in this place,<br>I shall pay dear.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1534	1539	6	48	It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.<br>In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,<br>Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet<br>Whiles you beguile the time and feed your<br>knowledge<br>With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1541	1543	3	24	Haply your eye shall light upon some toy<br>You have desire to purchase, and your store,<br>I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
ANTONIO-TN	3	3	1546	1546	1	3	To th’ Elephant.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1873	1875	3	26	Put up your sword. If this young gentleman<br>Have done offense, I take the fault on me.<br>If you offend him, I for him defy you.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1877	1878	2	20	One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more<br>Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1890	1890	1	5	You do mistake me, sir.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1894	1901	8	56	I must obey. This comes with seeking<br>you.<br>But there’s no remedy. I shall answer it.<br>What will you do, now my necessity<br>Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me<br>Much more for what I cannot do for you<br>Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,<br>But be of comfort.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1903	1903	1	9	I must entreat of you some of that money.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1911	1916	6	43	Will you deny me now?<br>Is ’t possible that my deserts to you<br>Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,<br>Lest that it make me so unsound a man<br>As to upbraid you with those kindnesses<br>That I have done for you.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1923	1923	1	3	O heavens themselves!
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1925	1929	5	42	Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here<br>I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,<br>Relieved him with such sanctity of love,<br>And to his image, which methought did promise<br>Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1931	1936	6	46	But O, how vile an idol proves this god!<br>Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.<br>In nature there’s no blemish but the mind;<br>None can be called deformed but the unkind.<br>Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil<br>Are empty trunks o’erflourished by the devil.
ANTONIO-TN	3	4	1939	1939	1	3	Lead me on.
ANTONIO-TN	5	1	2272	2293	22	157	Orsino, noble sir,<br>Be pleased that I shake off these names you give<br>me.<br>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,<br>Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,<br>Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.<br>That most ingrateful boy there by your side<br>From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth<br>Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.<br>His life I gave him and did thereto add<br>My love, without retention or restraint,<br>All his in dedication. For his sake<br>Did I expose myself, pure for his love,<br>Into the danger of this adverse town;<br>Drew to defend him when he was beset;<br>Where, being apprehended, his false cunning<br>(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)<br>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance<br>And grew a twenty years’ removèd thing<br>While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,<br>Which I had recommended to his use<br>Not half an hour before.
ANTONIO-TN	5	1	2296	2298	3	22	Today, my lord; and for three months before,<br>No int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,<br>Both day and night did we keep company.
ANTONIO-TN	5	1	2434	2434	1	3	Sebastian are you?
ANTONIO-TN	5	1	2436	2438	3	23	How have you made division of yourself?<br>An apple cleft in two is not more twin<br>Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	108	109	2	19	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.<br>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	45	45	1	4	This is Illyria, lady.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	50	50	1	8	It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	52	61	10	77	True, madam. And to comfort you with chance,<br>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,<br>When you and those poor number saved with you<br>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,<br>Most provident in peril, bind himself<br>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)<br>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,<br>Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,<br>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves<br>So long as I could see.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	66	67	2	17	Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born<br>Not three hours’ travel from this very place.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	69	69	1	8	A noble duke, in nature as in name.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	71	71	1	1	Orsino.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	74	78	5	45	And so is now, or was so very late;<br>For but a month ago I went from hence,<br>And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as, you know,<br>What great ones do the less will prattle of)<br>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	80	85	6	43	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count<br>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her<br>In the protection of his son, her brother,<br>Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,<br>They say, she hath abjured the sight<br>And company of men.
CAPTAIN-TN	1	2	90	92	3	17	That were hard to compass<br>Because she will admit no kind of suit,<br>No, not the Duke’s.
CURIO	1	1	16	16	1	6	Will you go hunt, my lord?
CURIO	1	1	18	18	1	2	The hart.
CURIO	2	4	899	900	2	12	He is not here, so please your lordship, that<br>should sing it.
CURIO	2	4	902	904	3	21	Feste the jester, my lord, a Fool that the Lady<br>Olivia’s father took much delight in. He is about<br>the house.
FABIAN	2	5	1029	1030	2	19	Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport,<br>let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
FABIAN	2	5	1033	1034	2	19	I would exult, man. You know he brought me<br>out o’ favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here.
FABIAN	2	5	1056	1058	3	16	O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare<br>turkeycock of him. How he jets under his advanced<br>plumes!
FABIAN	2	5	1068	1069	2	11	O, peace, now he’s deeply in. Look how<br>imagination blows him.
FABIAN	2	5	1077	1077	1	3	O, peace, peace!
FABIAN	2	5	1083	1083	1	6	O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
FABIAN	2	5	1089	1090	2	11	Though our silence be drawn from us<br>with cars, yet peace!
FABIAN	2	5	1102	1103	2	10	Nay, patience, or we break the sinews<br>of our plot!
FABIAN	2	5	1112	1112	1	7	Now is the woodcock near the gin.
FABIAN	2	5	1125	1125	1	6	This wins him, liver and all.
FABIAN	2	5	1138	1138	1	3	A fustian riddle!
FABIAN	2	5	1142	1143	2	8	What dish o’ poison has she dressed<br>him!
FABIAN	2	5	1154	1155	2	16	Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this,<br>though it be as rank as a fox.
FABIAN	2	5	1158	1159	2	15	Did not I say he would work it out? The<br>cur is excellent at faults.
FABIAN	2	5	1163	1163	1	6	And <span class="quote" data-words="1">O</span> shall end, I hope.
FABIAN	2	5	1167	1169	3	20	Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you<br>might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes<br>before you.
FABIAN	2	5	1211	1212	2	20	I will not give my part of this sport for a<br>pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
FABIAN	2	5	1218	1218	1	5	Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
FABIAN	3	2	1414	1414	1	8	You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
FABIAN	3	2	1421	1422	2	11	This was a great argument of love in her toward<br>you.
FABIAN	3	2	1424	1425	2	13	I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of<br>judgment and reason.
FABIAN	3	2	1428	1440	13	112	She did show favor to the youth in your sight<br>only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse<br>valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in<br>your liver. You should then have accosted her, and<br>with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,<br>you should have banged the youth into dumbness.<br>This was looked for at your hand, and this was<br>balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let<br>time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north<br>of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an<br>icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem<br>it by some laudable attempt either of valor or<br>policy.
FABIAN	3	2	1450	1450	1	8	There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
FABIAN	3	2	1463	1463	1	9	This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
FABIAN	3	2	1466	1467	2	13	We shall have a rare letter from him. But you’ll<br>not deliver ’t?
FABIAN	3	2	1474	1475	2	14	And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage<br>no great presage of cruelty.
FABIAN	3	4	1641	1642	2	18	Here he is, here he is.—How is ’t with you, sir?<br>How is ’t with you, man?

He is indeed, sir, the most skillful,<br>bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly<br>have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk<br>towards him? I will make your peace with him if I<br>can.

FESTE	1	5	325	330	6	53	Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good<br>fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very<br>oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may<br>pass for a wise man.

FESTE	1	5	335	346	12	107	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel<br>will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is<br>the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend<br>himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he<br>cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s<br>mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is<br>but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but<br>patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism<br>will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is<br>no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower.<br>The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say<br>again, take her away.

FESTE	2	4	965	965	1	9	No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.

FESTE	3	1	1242	1242	1	7	No, sir, I live by the church.

FESTE	3	1	1250	1252	3	28	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is<br>but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the<br>wrong side may be turned outward!

FESTE	3	1	1258	1261	4	27	Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with<br>that word might make my sister wanton. But,<br>indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced<br>them.

FESTE	3	1	1273	1277	5	45	No, indeed, sir. The Lady Olivia has no folly. She<br>will keep no Fool, sir, till she be married, and Fools<br>are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings: the<br>husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her Fool but<br>her corrupter of words.
FESTE	3	1	1279	1282	4	39	Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the<br>sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but<br>the Fool should be as oft with your master as with<br>my mistress. I think I saw your Wisdom there.

FIRST_OFFICER	5	1	2259	2264	6	47	Orsino, this is that Antonio<br>That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,<br>And this is he that did the Tiger board<br>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.<br>Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,<br>In private brabble did we apprehend him.
MALVOLIO	1	5	368	370	3	22	Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death<br>shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth<br>ever make the better Fool.
MALVOLIO	1	5	376	383	8	73	I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in<br>such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other<br>day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain<br>than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard<br>already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to<br>him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men<br>that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than<br>the Fools’ zanies.
MALVOLIO	1	5	432	439	8	66	Madam, yond young fellow swears he will<br>speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes<br>on him to understand so much, and therefore<br>comes to speak with you. I told him you were<br>asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that<br>too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is<br>to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any<br>denial.
MALVOLIO	1	5	441	443	3	28	Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at<br>your door like a sheriff’s post and be the supporter<br>to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.
MALVOLIO	1	5	445	445	1	3	Why, of mankind.
MALVOLIO	1	5	447	448	2	12	Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you,<br>will you or no.
MALVOLIO	1	5	450	456	7	59	Not yet old enough for a man, nor young<br>enough for a boy—as a squash is before ’tis a<br>peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis<br>with him in standing water, between boy and man.<br>He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.<br>One would think his mother’s milk were<br>scarce out of him.
MALVOLIO	1	5	458	458	1	4	Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
MALVOLIO	1	5	601	601	1	5	Here, madam, at your service.
MALVOLIO	1	5	609	609	1	3	Madam, I will.
MALVOLIO	2	2	661	662	2	9	Were not you even now with the Countess<br>Olivia?
MALVOLIO	2	2	665	671	7	67	She returns this ring to you, sir. You might<br>have saved me my pains to have taken it away<br>yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put<br>your lord into a desperate assurance she will none<br>of him. And one thing more, that you be never so<br>hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to<br>report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.
MALVOLIO	2	2	673	676	4	42	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and<br>her will is it should be so returned.<br>If it be worth stooping for, there it<br>lies, in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.
MALVOLIO	2	3	788	794	7	60	My masters, are you mad? Or what are you?<br>Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to<br>gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you<br>make an ale-house of my lady’s house, that you<br>squeak out your coziers’ catches without any mitigation<br>or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of<br>place, persons, nor time in you?
MALVOLIO	2	3	796	802	7	62	Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady<br>bade me tell you that, though she harbors you as her<br>kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders. If<br>you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,<br>you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would<br>please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to<br>bid you farewell.
MALVOLIO	2	3	806	806	1	4	Is ’t even so?
MALVOLIO	2	3	809	809	1	6	This is much credit to you.
MALVOLIO	2	3	821	824	4	30	Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor<br>at anything more than contempt, you would not give<br>means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by<br>this hand.
MALVOLIO	2	5	1049	1054	6	54	’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once<br>told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself<br>come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be<br>one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a<br>more exalted respect than anyone else that follows<br>her. What should I think on ’t?
MALVOLIO	2	5	1061	1061	1	4	To be Count Malvolio.
MALVOLIO	2	5	1065	1066	2	16	There is example for ’t. The lady of the<br>Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
MALVOLIO	2	5	1070	1071	2	11	Having been three months married to her,<br>sitting in my state—
MALVOLIO	2	5	1073	1075	3	21	Calling my officers about me, in my<br>branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed,<br>where I have left Olivia sleeping—
MALVOLIO	2	5	1078	1081	4	34	And then to have the humor of state; and<br>after a demure travel of regard, telling them I<br>know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to<br>ask for my kinsman Toby—
MALVOLIO	2	5	1084	1087	4	35	Seven of my people, with an obedient start,<br>make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance<br>wind up my watch, or play with my—some<br>rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—
MALVOLIO	2	5	1091	1093	3	17	I extend my hand to him thus, quenching<br>my familiar smile with an austere regard of<br>control—
MALVOLIO	2	5	1096	1096	3	17	Saying, <span class="quote" data-words="16">Cousin Toby, my fortunes, havingcast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of<br>speech—</span>
MALVOLIO	2	5	1100	1100	1	5	<span class="quote" data-words="5">You must amend your drunkenness.</span>
MALVOLIO	2	5	1104	1104	2	12	<span class="quote" data-words="12">Besides, you waste the treasure of yourtime with a foolish knight—</span>
MALVOLIO	2	5	1107	1107	1	3	<span class="quote" data-words="3">One Sir Andrew.</span>
MALVOLIO	2	5	1110	1111	2	5	What employment have<br>we here?
MALVOLIO	2	5	1115	1118	4	33	By my life, this is my<br>lady’s hand! These be her very c’s, her u’s, and her<br>t’s, and thus she makes her great P’s. It is in<br>contempt of question her hand.

MALVOLIO	4	2	2058	2059	2	11	Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to<br>my lady—
MALVOLIO	4	2	2063	2065	3	24	Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged.<br>Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have<br>laid me here in hideous darkness—
MALVOLIO	4	2	2070	2070	1	4	As hell, Sir Topas.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2075	2076	2	14	I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this<br>house is dark.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2080	2084	5	42	I say this house is as dark as ignorance,<br>though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say<br>there was never man thus abused. I am no more<br>mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any<br>constant question.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2087	2088	2	11	That the soul of our grandam might haply<br>inhabit a bird.

MALVOLIO	4	2	2118	2121	4	36	Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at<br>my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and<br>paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful<br>to thee for ’t.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2123	2123	1	3	Ay, good Fool.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2125	2126	2	19	Fool, there was never man so notoriously<br>abused. I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2129	2131	3	26	They have here propertied me, keep me in<br>darkness, send ministers to me—asses!—and do<br>all they can to face me out of my wits.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2136	2136	1	2	Sir Topas!
MALVOLIO	4	2	2141	2141	1	5	Fool! Fool! Fool, I say!
MALVOLIO	4	2	2144	2146	3	25	Good Fool, help me to some light and some<br>paper. I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any<br>man in Illyria.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2148	2151	4	34	By this hand, I am. Good Fool, some ink,<br>paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to<br>my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the<br>bearing of letter did.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2154	2154	1	9	Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.
MALVOLIO	4	2	2157	2158	2	11	Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I<br>prithee, begone.
MALVOLIO	5	1	2551	2553	3	8	Madam, you have done me<br>wrong,<br>Notorious wrong.
MALVOLIO	5	1	2555	2569	15	127	Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.<br>You must not now deny it is your hand.<br>Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,<br>Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.<br>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,<br>And tell me, in the modesty of honor,<br>Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?<br>Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,<br>To put on yellow stockings, and to frown<br>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?<br>And, acting this in an obedient hope,<br>Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,<br>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,<br>And made the most notorious geck and gull<br>That e’er invention played on? Tell me why.
MALVOLIO	5	1	2604	2604	1	9	I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you!
MARIA-TN	1	3	114	116	3	23	By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier<br>o’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions<br>to your ill hours.
MARIA-TN	1	3	118	119	2	12	Ay, but you must confine yourself within the<br>modest limits of order.
MARIA-TN	1	3	124	127	4	31	That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I<br>heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish<br>knight that you brought in one night here to be her<br>wooer.
MARIA-TN	1	3	129	129	1	2	Ay, he.
MARIA-TN	1	3	131	131	1	5	What’s that to th’ purpose?
MARIA-TN	1	3	133	134	2	18	Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats.<br>He’s a very fool and a prodigal.
MARIA-TN	1	3	139	143	5	47	He hath indeed, almost natural, for, besides<br>that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler, and, but that<br>he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath<br>in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he<br>would quickly have the gift of a grave.
MARIA-TN	1	3	146	147	2	10	They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in<br>your company.
MARIA-TN	1	3	157	157	1	4	And you too, sir.
MARIA-TN	1	3	163	163	1	5	My name is Mary, sir.
MARIA-TN	1	3	169	169	1	4	Fare you well, gentlemen.
MARIA-TN	1	3	175	175	1	8	Sir, I have not you by th’ hand.
MARIA-TN	1	3	178	180	3	19	Now sir, thought is free. I<br>pray you, bring your hand to th’ butt’ry bar and let<br>it drink.
MARIA-TN	1	3	183	183	1	3	It’s dry, sir.
MARIA-TN	1	3	186	186	1	4	A dry jest, sir.
MARIA-TN	1	3	188	189	2	19	Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry,<br>now I let go your hand, I am barren.
MARIA-TN	1	5	296	299	4	35	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I<br>will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter<br>in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy<br>absence.
MARIA-TN	1	5	302	302	1	3	Make that good.
MARIA-TN	1	5	304	305	2	18	A good Lenten answer. I can tell thee where<br>that saying was born, of <span class="quote" data-words="4">I fear no colors.</span>
MARIA-TN	1	5	307	308	2	14	In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in<br>your foolery.
MARIA-TN	1	5	311	313	3	25	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.<br>Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a<br>hanging to you?
MARIA-TN	1	5	316	316	1	4	You are resolute, then?
MARIA-TN	1	5	318	319	2	15	That if one break, the other will hold, or, if both<br>break, your gaskins fall.
MARIA-TN	1	5	323	324	2	18	Peace, you rogue. No more o’ that. Here comes<br>my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.
MARIA-TN	1	5	393	394	2	15	Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman<br>much desires to speak with you.
MARIA-TN	1	5	396	397	2	12	I know not, madam. ’Tis a fair young man, and<br>well attended.
MARIA-TN	1	5	399	399	1	5	Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
MARIA-TN	1	5	495	495	1	9	Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
MARIA-TN	2	3	774	776	3	28	What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my<br>lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and<br>bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.
MARIA-TN	2	3	787	787	1	6	For the love o’ God, peace!
MARIA-TN	2	3	804	804	1	4	Nay, good Sir Toby.
MARIA-TN	2	3	825	825	1	4	Go shake your ears!
MARIA-TN	2	3	832	838	7	66	Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the<br>youth of the Count’s was today with my lady, she is<br>much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me<br>alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword<br>and make him a common recreation, do not think I<br>have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I<br>can do it.
MARIA-TN	2	3	840	840	1	9	Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
MARIA-TN	2	3	846	853	8	68	The devil a puritan that he is, or anything<br>constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass<br>that cons state without book and utters it by great<br>swaths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed,<br>as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds<br>of faith that all that look on him love him. And on<br>that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause<br>to work.
MARIA-TN	2	3	855	861	7	64	I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of<br>love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of<br>his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his<br>eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself<br>most feelingly personated. I can write very like my<br>lady your niece; on a forgotten matter, we can<br>hardly make distinction of our hands.
MARIA-TN	2	3	867	867	1	9	My purpose is indeed a horse of that color.
MARIA-TN	2	3	869	869	1	4	Ass, I doubt not.
MARIA-TN	2	3	871	875	5	47	Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic<br>will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the<br>Fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.<br>Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed,<br>and dream on the event. Farewell.
MARIA-TN	2	5	1041	1048	8	73	Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio’s<br>coming down this walk. He has been yonder i’ the<br>sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half<br>hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I<br>know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of<br>him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie<br>thou there for here comes<br>the trout that must be caught with tickling.
MARIA-TN	2	5	1226	1226	1	9	Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
MARIA-TN	2	5	1228	1236	9	77	If you will then see the fruits of the sport,<br>mark his first approach before my lady. He will<br>come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color<br>she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;<br>and he will smile upon her, which will now<br>be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted<br>to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot<br>but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will<br>see it, follow me.
MARIA-TN	3	2	1477	1482	6	47	If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves<br>into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is<br>turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no<br>Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly<br>can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.<br>He’s in yellow stockings.
MARIA-TN	3	2	1484	1492	9	89	Most villainously, like a pedant that keeps a<br>school i’ th’ church. I have dogged him like his<br>murderer. He does obey every point of the letter<br>that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face<br>into more lines than is in the new map with the<br>augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such<br>a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at<br>him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll<br>smile and take ’t for a great favor.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1556	1557	2	13	He’s coming, madam, but in very strange manner.<br>He is sure possessed, madam.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1559	1561	3	29	No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your<br>Ladyship were best to have some guard about you if<br>he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1584	1584	1	4	How do you, Malvolio?
MARIA-TN	3	4	1587	1588	2	10	Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness<br>before my lady?
MARIA-TN	3	4	1645	1647	3	25	Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks<br>within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady<br>prays you to have a care of him.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1654	1656	3	21	La you, an you speak ill of the devil,<br>how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not<br>bewitched!
MARIA-TN	3	4	1658	1660	3	22	Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning<br>if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than<br>I’ll say.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1662	1662	1	2	O Lord!
MARIA-TN	3	4	1674	1675	2	13	Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby; get<br>him to pray.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1677	1678	2	10	No, I warrant you, he will not hear of<br>godliness.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1687	1688	2	11	Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air<br>and taint.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1690	1690	1	6	The house will be the quieter.
MARIA-TN	3	4	1728	1730	3	23	You may have very fit occasion for ’t. He is now<br>in some commerce with my lady, and will by and<br>by depart.
MARIA-TN	4	2	2034	2036	3	28	Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;<br>make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do<br>it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.
MARIA-TN	4	2	2100	2101	2	14	Thou mightst have done this without thy beard<br>and gown. He sees thee not.
OLIVIA	1	5	331	331	1	4	Take the Fool away.
OLIVIA	1	5	333	334	2	15	Go to, you’re a dry Fool. I’ll no more of you.<br>Besides, you grow dishonest.
OLIVIA	1	5	347	347	1	7	Sir, I bade them take away you.
OLIVIA	1	5	352	352	1	4	Can you do it?
OLIVIA	1	5	354	354	1	3	Make your proof.
OLIVIA	1	5	357	358	2	11	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide<br>your proof.
OLIVIA	1	5	360	360	1	6	Good Fool, for my brother’s death.
OLIVIA	1	5	362	362	1	8	I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.
OLIVIA	1	5	366	367	2	11	What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he<br>not mend?
OLIVIA	1	5	375	375	1	6	How say you to that, Malvolio?
OLIVIA	1	5	384	390	7	61	O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste<br>with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless,<br>and of free disposition is to take those things<br>for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There<br>is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do<br>nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet<br>man, though he do nothing but reprove.
OLIVIA	1	5	395	395	1	6	From the Count Orsino, is it?
OLIVIA	1	5	398	398	1	8	Who of my people hold him in delay?
OLIVIA	1	5	400	405	6	55	Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing<br>but madman. Fie on him! Go you,<br>Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick,<br>or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.<br>Now you see, sir, how your fooling<br>grows old, and people dislike it.
OLIVIA	1	5	410	411	2	12	By mine honor, half drunk!—What is he at the<br>gate, cousin?
OLIVIA	1	5	413	413	1	4	A gentleman? What gentleman?
OLIVIA	1	5	417	418	2	11	Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by<br>this lethargy?
OLIVIA	1	5	420	420	1	5	Ay, marry, what is he?
OLIVIA	1	5	423	423	1	6	What’s a drunken man like, Fool?
OLIVIA	1	5	427	429	3	27	Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o’<br>my coz, for he’s in the third degree of drink: he’s<br>drowned. Go look after him.
OLIVIA	1	5	440	440	1	8	Tell him he shall not speak with me.
OLIVIA	1	5	444	444	1	6	What kind o’ man is he?
OLIVIA	1	5	446	446	1	4	What manner of man?
OLIVIA	1	5	449	449	1	7	Of what personage and years is he?
OLIVIA	1	5	457	457	1	7	Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
OLIVIA	1	5	459	460	2	18	Give me my veil. Come, throw it o’er my face.<br>We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.
OLIVIA	1	5	462	462	1	10	Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?
OLIVIA	1	5	470	470	1	4	Whence came you, sir?
OLIVIA	1	5	475	475	1	4	Are you a comedian?
OLIVIA	1	5	479	479	1	8	If I do not usurp myself, I am.
OLIVIA	1	5	485	486	2	12	Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you<br>the praise.
OLIVIA	1	5	489	494	6	63	It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you,<br>keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and<br>allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than<br>to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have<br>reason, be brief. ’Tis not that time of moon with me<br>to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
OLIVIA	1	5	499	499	1	4	Tell me your mind.
OLIVIA	1	5	501	503	3	19	Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver<br>when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your<br>office.
OLIVIA	1	5	507	508	2	10	Yet you began rudely. What are you? What<br>would you?
OLIVIA	1	5	513	515	3	20	Give us the place alone. We will hear this<br>divinity. Now, sir, what<br>is your text?
OLIVIA	1	5	517	518	2	14	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said<br>of it. Where lies your text?
OLIVIA	1	5	520	520	1	9	In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
OLIVIA	1	5	522	523	2	14	O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more<br>to say?
OLIVIA	1	5	525	529	5	49	Have you any commission from your lord to<br>negotiate with my face? You are now out of your<br>text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the<br>picture. Look you, sir, such a<br>one I was this present. Is ’t not well done?
OLIVIA	1	5	531	532	2	9	’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and<br>weather.
OLIVIA	1	5	538	544	7	59	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give<br>out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be<br>inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled<br>to my will: as, <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">item</span>, two lips indifferent red; <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">item</span>,<br>two gray eyes, with lids to them; <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">item</span>, one neck, one<br>chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise<br>me?
OLIVIA	1	5	551	551	1	5	How does he love me?
OLIVIA	1	5	554	560	7	59	Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.<br>Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,<br>Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;<br>In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,<br>And in dimension and the shape of nature<br>A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.<br>He might have took his answer long ago.
OLIVIA	1	5	565	565	1	4	Why, what would you?
OLIVIA	1	5	575	576	2	8	You might do much.<br>What is your parentage?
OLIVIA	1	5	579	583	5	41	Get you to your lord.<br>I cannot love him. Let him send no more—<br>Unless perchance you come to me again<br>To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.<br>I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.
OLIVIA	1	5	589	599	12	81	<span class="quote" data-words="4">What is your parentage?</span><br><span class="quote" data-words="12">Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.I am a gentleman.</span> I’ll be sworn thou art.<br>Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit<br>Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,<br>soft!<br>Unless the master were the man. How now?<br>Even so quickly may one catch the plague?<br>Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections<br>With an invisible and subtle stealth<br>To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.—<br>What ho, Malvolio!
OLIVIA	1	5	602	608	7	67	Run after that same peevish messenger,<br>The County’s man. He left this ring behind him,<br>Would I or not. Tell him I’ll none of it.<br>Desire him not to flatter with his lord,<br>Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him.<br>If that the youth will come this way tomorrow,<br>I’ll give him reasons for ’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.
OLIVIA	1	5	610	613	4	37	I do I know not what, and fear to find<br>Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.<br>Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe.<br>What is decreed must be, and be this so.
OLIVIA	3	1	1333	1335	3	24	Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to<br>my hearing.<br>Give me your hand, sir.
OLIVIA	3	1	1337	1337	1	4	What is your name?
OLIVIA	3	1	1339	1341	3	20	My servant, sir? ’Twas never merry world<br>Since lowly feigning was called compliment.<br>You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
OLIVIA	3	1	1344	1345	2	19	For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,<br>Would they were blanks rather than filled with me.
OLIVIA	3	1	1348	1352	5	34	O, by your leave, I pray you.<br>I bade you never speak again of him.<br>But would you undertake another suit,<br>I had rather hear you to solicit that<br>Than music from the spheres.
OLIVIA	3	1	1354	1367	14	103	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,<br>After the last enchantment you did here,<br>A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse<br>Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.<br>Under your hard construction must I sit,<br>To force that on you in a shameful cunning<br>Which you knew none of yours. What might you<br>think?<br>Have you not set mine honor at the stake,<br>And baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts<br>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your<br>receiving<br>Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,<br>Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
OLIVIA	3	1	1369	1369	1	5	That’s a degree to love.
OLIVIA	3	1	1372	1380	9	82	Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again.<br>O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!<br>If one should be a prey, how much the better<br>To fall before the lion than the wolf.<br>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.<br>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.<br>And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,<br>Your wife is like to reap a proper man.<br>There lies your way, due west.
OLIVIA	3	1	1384	1384	1	10	Stay. I prithee, tell me what thou think’st of me.
OLIVIA	3	1	1386	1386	1	10	If I think so, I think the same of you.
OLIVIA	3	1	1388	1388	1	10	I would you were as I would have you be.
OLIVIA	3	1	1391	1403	13	97	O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful<br>In the contempt and anger of his lip!<br>A murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon<br>Than love that would seem hid. Love’s night is<br>noon.—<br>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,<br>By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything,<br>I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,<br>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.<br>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,<br>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;<br>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:<br>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.
OLIVIA	3	1	1410	1411	2	17	Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move<br>That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
OLIVIA	3	4	1548	1555	8	51	I have sent after him. He says he’ll come.<br>How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?<br>For youth is bought more oft than begged or<br>borrowed.<br>I speak too loud.—<br>Where’s Malvolio? He is sad and civil<br>And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.<br>Where is Malvolio?
OLIVIA	3	4	1558	1558	1	7	Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?
OLIVIA	3	4	1562	1564	3	26	Go call him hither. I am as mad as he,<br>If sad and merry madness equal be.<br>How now, Malvolio?
OLIVIA	3	4	1566	1567	2	10	Smil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad<br>occasion.
OLIVIA	3	4	1573	1574	2	11	Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter<br>with thee?
OLIVIA	3	4	1579	1579	1	6	Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
OLIVIA	3	4	1582	1583	2	14	God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and<br>kiss thy hand so oft?
OLIVIA	3	4	1591	1591	1	6	What mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?
OLIVIA	3	4	1593	1593	1	1	Ha?
OLIVIA	3	4	1595	1595	1	3	What sayst thou?
OLIVIA	3	4	1598	1598	1	3	Heaven restore thee!
OLIVIA	3	4	1601	1601	1	3	Thy yellow stockings?
OLIVIA	3	4	1603	1603	1	1	Cross-gartered?
OLIVIA	3	4	1606	1606	1	3	Am I made?
OLIVIA	3	4	1608	1608	1	6	Why, this is very midsummer madness!
OLIVIA	3	4	1612	1616	5	41	I’ll come to him. Good Maria, let<br>this fellow be looked to. Where’s my Cousin Toby?<br>Let some of my people have a special care of him. I<br>would not have him miscarry for the half of my<br>dowry.
OLIVIA	3	4	1756	1760	5	39	I have said too much unto a heart of stone<br>And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t.<br>There’s something in me that reproves my fault,<br>But such a headstrong potent fault it is<br>That it but mocks reproof.
OLIVIA	3	4	1763	1767	5	42	Here, wear this jewel for me. ’Tis my picture.<br>Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.<br>And I beseech you come again tomorrow.<br>What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,<br>That honor, saved, may upon asking give?
OLIVIA	3	4	1769	1770	2	15	How with mine honor may I give him that<br>Which I have given to you?
OLIVIA	3	4	1772	1773	2	17	Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.<br>A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
OLIVIA	4	1	2009	2009	1	9	Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee, hold!
OLIVIA	4	1	2011	2025	15	106	Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,<br>Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,<br>Where manners ne’er were preached! Out of my<br>sight!—<br>Be not offended, dear Cesario.—<br>Rudesby, begone!<br>I prithee, gentle friend,<br>Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway<br>In this uncivil and unjust extent<br>Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,<br>And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks<br>This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby<br>Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.<br>Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me!<br>He started one poor heart of mine, in thee.
OLIVIA	4	1	2030	2031	2	11	Nay, come, I prithee. Would thou ’dst be ruled by<br>me!
OLIVIA	4	1	2033	2033	1	6	O, say so, and so be!
OLIVIA	4	3	2189	2198	10	79	Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,<br>Now go with me and with this holy man<br>Into the chantry by. There, before him<br>And underneath that consecrated roof,<br>Plight me the full assurance of your faith,<br>That my most jealous and too doubtful soul<br>May live at peace. He shall conceal it<br>Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,<br>What time we will our celebration keep<br>According to my birth. What do you say?
OLIVIA	4	3	2201	2203	3	19	Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so<br>shine<br>That they may fairly note this act of mine.
OLIVIA	5	1	2305	2307	3	23	What would my lord, but that he may not have,<br>Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?—<br>Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
OLIVIA	5	1	2310	2310	1	8	What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord—
OLIVIA	5	1	2312	2314	3	23	If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,<br>It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear<br>As howling after music.
OLIVIA	5	1	2316	2316	1	4	Still so constant, lord.
OLIVIA	5	1	2321	2321	1	10	Even what it please my lord that shall become him.
OLIVIA	5	1	2340	2340	1	3	Where goes Cesario?
OLIVIA	5	1	2346	2346	1	7	Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!
OLIVIA	5	1	2348	2349	2	13	Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?—<br>Call forth the holy father.
OLIVIA	5	1	2351	2351	1	6	Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.
OLIVIA	5	1	2353	2353	1	6	Ay, husband. Can he that deny?
OLIVIA	5	1	2356	2366	11	79	Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear<br>That makes thee strangle thy propriety.<br>Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up.<br>Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art<br>As great as that thou fear’st.<br>O, welcome, father.<br>Father, I charge thee by thy reverence<br>Here to unfold (though lately we intended<br>To keep in darkness what occasion now<br>Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know<br>Hath newly passed between this youth and me.
OLIVIA	5	1	2383	2384	2	13	O, do not swear.<br>Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
OLIVIA	5	1	2387	2387	1	3	What’s the matter?
OLIVIA	5	1	2392	2392	1	6	Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
OLIVIA	5	1	2415	2416	2	10	Away with him! Who hath made this havoc<br>with them?
OLIVIA	5	1	2421	2421	1	11	Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
OLIVIA	5	1	2439	2439	1	2	Most wonderful!
OLIVIA	5	1	2494	2500	7	50	He shall enlarge him.<br>Fetch Malvolio hither.<br>And yet, alas, now I remember me,<br>They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.<br>A most extracting frenzy of mine own<br>From my remembrance clearly banished his.<br>How does he, sirrah?
OLIVIA	5	1	2506	2506	1	5	Open ’t and read it.
OLIVIA	5	1	2510	2510	1	5	How now, art thou mad?
OLIVIA	5	1	2514	2514	1	6	Prithee, read i’ thy right wits.
OLIVIA	5	1	2518	2518	1	4	Read it you, sirrah.
OLIVIA	5	1	2529	2529	1	4	Did he write this?
OLIVIA	5	1	2532	2538	7	51	See him delivered, Fabian. Bring him hither.<br>My lord, so please you, these things<br>further thought on,<br>To think me as well a sister as a wife,<br>One day shall crown th’ alliance on ’t, so please<br>you,<br>Here at my house, and at my proper cost.
OLIVIA	5	1	2547	2547	1	5	A sister! You are she.
OLIVIA	5	1	2549	2550	2	8	Ay, my lord, this same.—<br>How now, Malvolio?
OLIVIA	5	1	2554	2554	1	4	Have I, Malvolio? No.
OLIVIA	5	1	2570	2580	11	87	Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,<br>Though I confess much like the character.<br>But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.<br>And now I do bethink me, it was she<br>First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,<br>And in such forms which here were presupposed<br>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.<br>This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee.<br>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,<br>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge<br>Of thine own cause.
OLIVIA	5	1	2595	2595	1	8	Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
OLIVIA	5	1	2605	2605	1	6	He hath been most notoriously abused.
ORSINO	1	1	1	15	15	114	If music be the food of love, play on.<br>Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,<br>The appetite may sicken and so die.<br>That strain again! It had a dying fall.<br>O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound<br>That breathes upon a bank of violets,<br>Stealing and giving odor. Enough; no more.<br>’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.<br>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,<br>That, notwithstanding thy capacity<br>Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,<br>Of what validity and pitch soe’er,<br>But falls into abatement and low price<br>Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy<br>That it alone is high fantastical.
ORSINO	1	1	17	17	1	2	What, Curio?
ORSINO	1	1	19	25	7	52	Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.<br>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,<br>Methought she purged the air of pestilence.<br>That instant was I turned into a hart,<br>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,<br>E’er since pursue me.<br>How now, what news from her?
ORSINO	1	1	35	43	9	77	O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame<br>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,<br>How will she love when the rich golden shaft<br>Hath killed the flock of all affections else<br>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,<br>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled<br>Her sweet perfections with one self king!<br>Away before me to sweet beds of flowers!<br>Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
ORSINO	1	4	260	260	1	4	Who saw Cesario, ho?
ORSINO	1	4	262	268	7	52	Stand you awhile aloof.—Cesario,<br>Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasped<br>To thee the book even of my secret soul.<br>Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her.<br>Be not denied access. Stand at her doors<br>And tell them, there thy fixèd foot shall grow<br>Till thou have audience.
ORSINO	1	4	272	273	2	12	Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds<br>Rather than make unprofited return.
ORSINO	1	4	275	279	5	41	O, then unfold the passion of my love.<br>Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith.<br>It shall become thee well to act my woes.<br>She will attend it better in thy youth<br>Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
ORSINO	1	4	281	292	12	91	Dear lad, believe it;<br>For they shall yet belie thy happy years<br>That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip<br>Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe<br>Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,<br>And all is semblative a womans part.<br>I know thy constellation is right apt<br>For this affair.—Some four or five attend him,<br>All, if you will, for I myself am best<br>When least in company.—Prosper well in this<br>And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,<br>To call his fortunes thine.
ORSINO	2	4	1005	1005	1	4	What dost thou know?
ORSINO	2	4	1011	1011	1	4	And what’s her history?
ORSINO	2	4	1021	1021	1	9	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
ORSINO	2	4	1025	1027	3	22	Ay, that’s the theme.<br>To her in haste. Give her this jewel. Say<br>My love can give no place, bide no denay.
ORSINO	2	4	891	898	8	52	Give me some music. Now, good<br>morrow, friends.—<br>Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,<br>That old and antique song we heard last night.<br>Methought it did relieve my passion much,<br>More than light airs and recollected terms<br>Of these most brisk and giddy-pacèd times.<br>Come, but one verse.
ORSINO	2	4	901	901	1	3	Who was it?
ORSINO	2	4	905	912	8	64	Seek him out and play the tune the<br>while.<br>Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,<br>In the sweet pangs of it remember me,<br>For such as I am, all true lovers are,<br>Unstaid and skittish in all motions else<br>Save in the constant image of the creature<br>That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
ORSINO	2	4	915	918	4	26	Thou dost speak masterly.<br>My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye<br>Hath stayed upon some favor that it loves.<br>Hath it not, boy?
ORSINO	2	4	920	920	1	6	What kind of woman is ’t?
ORSINO	2	4	922	922	1	10	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i’ faith?
ORSINO	2	4	924	930	7	50	Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take<br>An elder than herself. So wears she to him;<br>So sways she level in her husband’s heart.<br>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,<br>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,<br>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,<br>Than women’s are.
ORSINO	2	4	932	935	4	31	Then let thy love be younger than thyself,<br>Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.<br>For women are as roses, whose fair flower,<br>Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
ORSINO	2	4	938	945	8	55	O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.—<br>Mark it, Cesario. It is old and plain;<br>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun<br>And the free maids that weave their thread with<br>bones<br>Do use to chant it. It is silly sooth,<br>And dallies with the innocence of love<br>Like the old age.
ORSINO	2	4	947	947	1	3	Ay, prithee, sing.
ORSINO	2	4	964	964	1	4	There’s for thy pains.
ORSINO	2	4	966	966	1	5	I’ll pay thy pleasure, then.
ORSINO	2	4	969	969	1	7	Give me now leave to leave thee.
ORSINO	2	4	977	985	9	69	Let all the rest give place.<br>Once more, Cesario,<br>Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.<br>Tell her my love, more noble than the world,<br>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands.<br>The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her,<br>Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune.<br>But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems<br>That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
ORSINO	2	4	987	987	1	5	I cannot be so answered.
ORSINO	2	4	993	1003	11	83	There is no woman’s sides<br>Can bide the beating of so strong a passion<br>As love doth give my heart; no woman’s heart<br>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.<br>Alas, their love may be called appetite,<br>No motion of the liver, but the palate,<br>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;<br>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,<br>And can digest as much. Make no compare<br>Between that love a woman can bear me<br>And that I owe Olivia.
ORSINO	5	1	2210	2210	1	7	Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
ORSINO	5	1	2212	2212	1	10	I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?
ORSINO	5	1	2215	2215	1	8	Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.
ORSINO	5	1	2217	2217	1	4	How can that be?
ORSINO	5	1	2225	2225	1	4	Why, this is excellent.
ORSINO	5	1	2228	2228	1	10	Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.
ORSINO	5	1	2231	2231	1	6	O, you give me ill counsel.
ORSINO	5	1	2234	2235	2	18	Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a<br>double-dealer: there’s another. 
ORSINO	5	1	2240	2243	4	38	You can fool no more money out of me at this<br>throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to<br>speak with her, and bring her along with you, it<br>may awake my bounty further.
ORSINO	5	1	2250	2258	9	72	That face of his I do remember well.<br>Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared<br>As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.<br>A baubling vessel was he captain of,<br>For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,<br>With which such scatheful grapple did he make<br>With the most noble bottom of our fleet<br>That very envy and the tongue of loss<br>Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?
ORSINO	5	1	2268	2271	4	26	Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,<br>What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies<br>Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,<br>Hast made thine enemies?
ORSINO	5	1	2295	2295	1	6	When came he to this town?
ORSINO	5	1	2299	2304	6	37	Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on<br>earth!—<br>But for thee, fellow: fellow, thy words are madness.<br>Three months this youth hath tended upon me—<br>But more of that anon. Take him<br>aside.
ORSINO	5	1	2309	2309	1	2	Gracious Olivia—
ORSINO	5	1	2315	2315	1	3	Still so cruel?
ORSINO	5	1	2317	2320	4	28	What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady,<br>To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars<br>My soul the faithful’st off’rings have breathed out<br>That e’er devotion tendered—what shall I do?
ORSINO	5	1	2322	2337	16	126	Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,<br>Like to th’ Egyptian thief at point of death,<br>Kill what I love?—a savage jealousy<br>That sometime savors nobly. But hear me this:<br>Since you to nonregardance cast my faith,<br>And that I partly know the instrument<br>That screws me from my true place in your favor,<br>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.<br>But this your minion, whom I know you love,<br>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,<br>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye<br>Where he sits crownèd in his master’s spite.—<br>Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in<br>mischief.<br>I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love<br>To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.
ORSINO	5	1	2350	2350	1	2	Come, away!
ORSINO	5	1	2352	2352	1	1	Husband?
ORSINO	5	1	2354	2354	1	3	Her husband, sirrah?
ORSINO	5	1	2376	2381	6	50	O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be<br>When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?<br>Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow<br>That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?<br>Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet<br>Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
ORSINO	5	1	2396	2396	1	3	My gentleman Cesario?
ORSINO	5	1	2408	2408	1	8	How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?
ORSINO	5	1	2429	2430	2	17	One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!<br>A natural perspective, that is and is not!
ORSINO	5	1	2479	2483	5	44	Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.<br>If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,<br>I shall have share in this most happy wrack.—<br>Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times<br>Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
ORSINO	5	1	2488	2489	2	13	Give me thy hand,<br>And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.
ORSINO	5	1	2531	2531	1	6	This savors not much of distraction.
ORSINO	5	1	2539	2546	8	59	Madam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.<br>Your master quits you; and for your<br>service done him,<br>So much against the mettle of your sex,<br>So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,<br>And since you called me <span class="quote" data-words="1">master</span> for so long,<br>Here is my hand. You shall from this time be<br>Your master’s mistress.
ORSINO	5	1	2548	2548	1	4	Is this the madman?
ORSINO	5	1	2606	2614	9	72	Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.<br>He hath not told us of the Captain yet.<br>When that is known, and golden time convents,<br>A solemn combination shall be made<br>Of our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister,<br>We will not part from hence.—Cesario, come,<br>For so you shall be while you are a man.<br>But when in other habits you are seen,<br>Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.
PRIEST-TN	5	1	2367	2375	9	57	A contract of eternal bond of love,<br>Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,<br>Attested by the holy close of lips,<br>Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,<br>And all the ceremony of this compact<br>Sealed in my function, by my testimony;<br>Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my<br>grave<br>I have traveled but two hours.
SEBASTIAN-TN	2	1	616	620	5	49	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly<br>over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps<br>distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your<br>leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad<br>recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
SEBASTIAN-TN	2	1	623	635	13	120	No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is<br>mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent<br>a touch of modesty that you will not extort<br>from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it<br>charges me in manners the rather to express myself.<br>You must know of me, then, Antonio, my name<br>is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was<br>that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have<br>heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister,<br>both born in an hour. If the heavens had been<br>pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir,<br>altered that, for some hour before you took me<br>from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
SEBASTIAN-TN	2	1	637	644	8	66	A lady, sir, though it was said she much<br>resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.<br>But though I could not with such estimable<br>wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly<br>publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but<br>call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,<br>though I seem to drown her remembrance again<br>with more.
SEBASTIAN-TN	2	1	646	646	1	7	O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
SEBASTIAN-TN	2	1	649	655	7	64	If you will not undo what you have done—<br>that is, kill him whom you have recovered—desire<br>it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of<br>kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my<br>mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine<br>eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count<br>Orsino’s court. Farewell.
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1494	1496	3	24	I would not by my will have troubled you,<br>But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,<br>I will no further chide you.
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1507	1513	7	53	My kind Antonio,<br>I can no other answer make but thanks,<br>And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns<br>Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.<br>But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,<br>You should find better dealing. What’s to do?<br>Shall we go see the relics of this town?
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1515	1518	4	30	I am not weary, and ’tis long to night.<br>I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes<br>With the memorials and the things of fame<br>That do renown this city.
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1524	1524	1	8	Belike you slew great number of his people?
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1533	1533	1	6	Do not then walk too open.
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1540	1540	1	4	Why I your purse?
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1544	1545	2	10	I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you<br>For an hour.
SEBASTIAN-TN	3	3	1547	1547	1	3	I do remember.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	1966	1967	2	15	Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let<br>me be clear of thee.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	1973	1974	2	11	I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.<br>Thou know’st not me.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	1981	1983	3	22	I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.<br>There’s money for thee. If you<br>tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	1989	1990	2	13	Why, there’s for thee,<br>and there, and there.—Are all the people mad?
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	2000	2000	1	4	Let go thy hand!
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	2004	2006	3	26	I will be free from thee.<br>What wouldst thou now?<br>If thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	2026	2029	4	37	What relish is in this? How runs the stream?<br>Or I am mad, or else this is a dream.<br>Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;<br>If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	1	2032	2032	1	3	Madam, I will.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	3	2167	2188	22	181	This is the air; that is the glorious sun.<br>This pearl she gave me, I do feel ’t and see ’t.<br>And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,<br>Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?<br>I could not find him at the Elephant.<br>Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,<br>That he did range the town to seek me out.<br>His counsel now might do me golden service.<br>For though my soul disputes well with my sense<br>That this may be some error, but no madness,<br>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune<br>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,<br>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes<br>And wrangle with my reason that persuades me<br>To any other trust but that I am mad—<br>Or else the lady’s mad. Yet if ’twere so,<br>She could not sway her house, command her<br>followers,<br>Take and give back affairs and their dispatch<br>With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing<br>As I perceive she does. There’s something in ’t<br>That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.
SEBASTIAN-TN	4	3	2199	2200	2	17	I’ll follow this good man and go with you,<br>And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2422	2428	7	61	I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,<br>But, had it been the brother of my blood,<br>I must have done no less with wit and safety.<br>You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that<br>I do perceive it hath offended you.<br>Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows<br>We made each other but so late ago.
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2431	2433	3	18	Antonio, O, my dear Antonio!<br>How have the hours racked and tortured me<br>Since I have lost thee!
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2435	2435	1	4	Fear’st thou that, Antonio?
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2440	2445	6	48	Do I stand there? I never had a brother,<br>Nor can there be that deity in my nature<br>Of here and everywhere. I had a sister,<br>Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.<br>Of charity, what kin are you to me?<br>What countryman? What name? What parentage?
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2451	2456	6	43	A spirit I am indeed,<br>But am in that dimension grossly clad<br>Which from the womb I did participate.<br>Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,<br>I should my tears let fall upon your cheek<br>And say <span class="quote" data-words="4">Thrice welcome, drownèd Viola.</span>
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2458	2458	1	4	And so had mine.
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2461	2463	3	22	O, that record is lively in my soul!<br>He finishèd indeed his mortal act<br>That day that made my sister thirteen years.
SEBASTIAN-TN	5	1	2474	2478	5	41	So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.<br>But nature to her bias drew in that.<br>You would have been contracted to a maid.<br>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived:<br>You are betrothed both to a maid and man.
SECOND_OFFICER	3	4	1888	1889	2	10	Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of<br>Count Orsino.
SECOND_OFFICER	3	4	1902	1902	1	3	Come, sir, away.
SECOND_OFFICER	3	4	1924	1924	1	6	Come, sir, I pray you go.
SERVANT	3	4	1609	1611	3	21	Madam, the young gentleman of the Count<br>Orsino’s is returned. I could hardly entreat him<br>back. He attends your Ladyship’s pleasure.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	111	113	3	22	What a plague means my niece to take the death<br>of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to<br>life.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	117	117	1	6	Why, let her except before excepted!
SIR_TOBY	1	3	120	123	4	35	Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am.<br>These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so<br>be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang<br>themselves in their own straps!
SIR_TOBY	1	3	128	128	1	4	Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	130	130	1	10	He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	132	132	1	8	Why, he has three thousand ducats a year!
SIR_TOBY	1	3	135	138	4	29	Fie, that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys,<br>and speaks three or four languages word<br>for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of<br>nature.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	144	145	2	16	By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors<br>that say so of him. Who are they?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	148	153	6	58	With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to<br>her as long as there is a passage in my throat and<br>drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that<br>will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’<br>toe like a parish top. What, wench! <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="es">Castiliano vulgo,</span><br>for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	155	155	1	3	Sweet Sir Andrew!
SIR_TOBY	1	3	158	158	1	4	Accost, Sir Andrew, accost!
SIR_TOBY	1	3	160	160	1	3	My niece’s chambermaid.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	165	166	2	13	You mistake, knight. <span class="quote" data-words="1">Accost</span> is front her, board<br>her, woo her, assail her.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	170	171	2	14	An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou<br>mightst never draw sword again.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	190	191	2	16	O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary! When did<br>I see thee so put down?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	197	197	1	2	No question.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	200	200	1	4	<span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="fr">Pourquoi,</span> my dear knight?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	205	205	1	9	Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	207	208	2	11	Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by<br>nature.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	210	212	3	24	Excellent! It hangs like flax on a distaff, and I<br>hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs<br>and spin it off.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	217	219	3	29	She’ll none o’ th’ Count. She’ll not match above<br>her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have<br>heard her swear ’t. Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	223	223	1	7	Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	227	227	1	8	What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	229	229	1	8	And I can cut the mutton to ’t.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	232	240	9	89	Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have<br>these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to<br>take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost<br>thou not go to church in a galliard and come home<br>in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would<br>not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.<br>What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues<br>in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy<br>leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
SIR_TOBY	1	3	244	245	2	11	What shall we do else? Were we not born under<br>Taurus?
SIR_TOBY	1	3	247	249	3	20	No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee<br>caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha,<br>excellent!
SIR_TOBY	1	5	412	412	1	2	A gentleman.
SIR_TOBY	1	5	414	415	2	13	’Tis a gentleman here.—a plague o’ these pickle<br>herring!—How now, sot?
SIR_TOBY	1	5	419	419	1	9	Lechery? I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.
SIR_TOBY	1	5	421	422	2	20	Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give<br>me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	702	704	3	19	Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after<br>midnight is to be up betimes, and <span class="quote" data-words="2"><span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">diluculo surgere,</span></span><br>thou know’st—
SIR_TOBY	2	3	707	711	5	46	A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To<br>be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early,<br>so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed<br>betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four<br>elements?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	714	715	2	17	Thou ’rt a scholar. Let us therefore eat and<br>drink. Marian, I say, a stoup of wine!
SIR_TOBY	2	3	719	719	1	7	Welcome, ass! Now let’s have a catch.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	733	734	2	11	Come on, there is<br>sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	739	739	1	6	A love song, a love song.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	748	748	1	2	Good, good.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	756	756	1	3	A contagious breath.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	758	761	4	40	To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.<br>But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall<br>we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw<br>three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	777	779	5	38	My lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio’s<br>a Peg-a-Ramsey, and <span class="song" data-words="5">Three merry men bewe.</span> Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her<br>blood? Tillyvally! <span class="quote" data-words="1">Lady</span>! <span class="song" data-words="8">There dwelt a manin Babylon, lady, lady.</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	786	786	1	6	<span class="song" data-words="6">O’ the twelfth day of December</span>—
SIR_TOBY	2	3	795	795	1	10	We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
SIR_TOBY	2	3	803	802	1	9	<span class="song" data-words="9">Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	807	806	1	5	<span class="song" data-words="5">But I will never die.</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	810	809	1	5	<span class="song" data-words="5">Shall I bid him go?</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	812	811	1	8	<span class="song" data-words="8">Shall I bid him go, and spare not?</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	814	816	3	27	Out o’ tune, sir? You lie. Art any more than a<br>steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,<br>there shall be no more cakes and ale?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	819	820	2	17	Thou ’rt i’ th’ right.—Go, sir, rub your chain<br>with crumbs.—A stoup of wine, Maria!
SIR_TOBY	2	3	830	831	2	19	Do ’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge. Or I’ll<br>deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	839	839	1	9	Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	842	843	2	10	What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason,<br>dear knight?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	854	854	1	4	What wilt thou do?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	862	862	1	5	Excellent! I smell a device.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	864	866	3	23	He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,<br>that they come from my niece, and that she’s in<br>love with him.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	876	876	1	3	Good night, Penthesilea.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	878	879	2	13	She’s a beagle true bred, and one that adores<br>me. What o’ that?
SIR_TOBY	2	3	881	882	2	11	Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for<br>more money.
SIR_TOBY	2	3	885	886	2	15	Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i’<br>th’ end, call me <span class="quote" data-words="1">Cut.</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	3	889	890	2	19	Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack. ’Tis too<br>late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1028	1028	1	5	Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1031	1032	2	16	Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly<br>rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1035	1037	3	21	To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we<br>will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir<br>Andrew?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1039	1040	2	11	Here comes the little villain.—How now, my<br>metal of India?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1055	1055	1	4	Here’s an overweening rogue.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1060	1060	1	3	Peace, I say.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1062	1062	1	2	Ah, rogue!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1064	1064	1	2	Peace, peace!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1072	1072	1	10	O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1076	1076	1	3	Fire and brimstone!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1082	1082	1	3	Bolts and shackles!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1088	1088	1	4	Shall this fellow live?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1094	1095	2	12	And does not Toby take you a blow o’ the<br>lips then?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1099	1099	1	2	What, what?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1101	1101	1	2	Out, scab!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1113	1114	2	12	O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate<br>reading aloud to him.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1133	1133	1	4	Marry, hang thee, brock!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1139	1139	1	4	Excellent wench, say I.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1144	1145	2	9	And with what wing the staniel checks<br>at it!
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1152	1153	2	12	O, ay, make up that.—He is now at a cold<br>scent.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1164	1165	2	10	Ay, or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">O.</span>
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1213	1213	1	8	I could marry this wench for this device.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1215	1216	2	11	And ask no other dowry with her but such<br>another jest.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1219	1219	1	8	Wilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1221	1222	2	11	Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become<br>thy bondslave?
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1224	1225	2	21	Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that<br>when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1227	1227	1	6	Like aqua vitae with a midwife.
SIR_TOBY	2	5	1237	1238	2	11	To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil<br>of wit!
SIR_TOBY	3	1	1309	1309	1	3	Save you, gentleman.
SIR_TOBY	3	1	1314	1315	2	18	Will you encounter the house? My niece is<br>desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
SIR_TOBY	3	1	1318	1318	1	8	Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
SIR_TOBY	3	1	1322	1322	1	7	I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1413	1413	1	7	Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1418	1419	2	11	Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me<br>that.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1426	1427	2	11	And they have been grand-jurymen since before<br>Noah was a sailor.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1444	1449	6	54	Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis<br>of valor. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight<br>with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall<br>take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no<br>love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s<br>commendation with woman than report of valor.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1452	1460	9	92	Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and<br>brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent<br>and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of<br>ink. If thou <span class="" data-words="0"><span class="quote" data-words="0">thou</span></span>-est him some thrice, it shall not<br>be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of<br>paper, although the sheet were big enough for the<br>bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go, about it.<br>Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou<br>write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1462	1462	1	7	We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1464	1465	2	13	I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand<br>strong, or so.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1468	1473	6	54	Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on<br>the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes<br>cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were<br>opened and you find so much blood in his liver as<br>will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’<br>anatomy.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1476	1476	1	8	Look where the youngest wren of mine comes.
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1483	1483	1	2	And cross-gartered?
SIR_TOBY	3	2	1493	1493	1	8	Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1638	1640	3	29	Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all<br>the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion<br>himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1649	1652	4	35	Go to, go to! Peace, peace.<br>We must deal gently with him. Let me alone.—How<br>do you, Malvolio? How is ’t with you? What, man,<br>defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1663	1665	3	21	Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do<br>you not see you move him? Let me alone with<br>him.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1668	1669	2	9	Why, how now, my bawcock? How<br>dost thou, chuck?
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1671	1673	3	21	Ay, biddy, come with me.—What, man, ’tis not<br>for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang<br>him, foul collier!
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1682	1682	1	3	Is ’t possible?
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1685	1686	2	11	His very genius hath taken the infection of the<br>device, man.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1691	1697	7	69	Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and<br>bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s<br>mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his<br>penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath,<br>prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we<br>will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a<br>finder of madmen. But see, but see!
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1703	1704	2	14	Give me. <span class="letter" data-words="4">Youth, whatsoever thou art,</span><br><span class="letter" data-words="6">thou art but a scurvy fellow.</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1706	1705	3	23	<span class="letter" data-words="23">Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,<br>why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason<br>for ’t.</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1711	1710	3	29	<span class="letter" data-words="29">Thou com’st to the Lady Olivia, and in my<br>sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat;<br>that is not the matter I challenge thee for.</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1715	1714	2	15	<span class="letter" data-words="15">I will waylay thee going home, where if it be<br>thy chance to kill me—</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1718	1717	1	9	<span class="letter" data-words="9">Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain.</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1721	1722	7	53	<span class="letter" data-words="40">Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon<br>one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but<br>my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as<br>thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,<span class="letter" data-words="2">Andrew Aguecheek.</span></span>If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll<br>give ’t him.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1731	1737	7	60	Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner<br>of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever<br>thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st, swear<br>horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,<br>with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives<br>manhood more approbation than ever proof itself<br>would have earned him. Away!
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1739	1751	13	118	Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior<br>of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good<br>capacity and breeding; his employment between<br>his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore,<br>this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed<br>no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a<br>clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by<br>word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable<br>report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know<br>his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous<br>opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This<br>will so fright them both that they will kill one<br>another by the look, like cockatrices.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1754	1755	2	12	I will meditate the while upon some horrid<br>message for a challenge.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1774	1774	1	4	Gentleman, God save thee.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1776	1781	6	53	That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t. Of what<br>nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know<br>not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as<br>the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount<br>thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy<br>assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1785	1788	4	37	You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore,<br>if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your<br>guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth,<br>strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1790	1795	7	57	He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and<br>on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private<br>brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and<br>his incensement at this moment is so implacable<br>that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death<br>and sepulcher. <span class="quote" data-words="2">Hob, nob</span> is his word; <span class="quote" data-words="5">give ’t ortake ’t.</span>
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1802	1809	8	64	Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very<br>competent injury. Therefore get you on and give<br>him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,<br>unless you undertake that with me which with as<br>much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,<br>or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you<br>must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about<br>you.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1814	1815	2	14	I will do so.—Signior Fabian, stay you by this<br>gentleman till my return.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1831	1837	7	65	Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such<br>a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard,<br>and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such<br>a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the<br>answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the<br>ground they step on. They say he has been fencer<br>to the Sophy.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1839	1840	2	14	Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can<br>scarce hold him yonder.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1846	1851	6	61	I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good<br>show on ’t. This shall end without the perdition of<br>souls. Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I<br>ride you.<br>I have his horse to take up the<br>quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1855	1860	6	48	There’s no remedy, sir; he will fight<br>with you for ’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better<br>bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now<br>scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for<br>the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not<br>hurt you.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1865	1869	5	47	Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy. The<br>gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout<br>with you. He cannot by the <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="it">duello</span> avoid it. But he<br>has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,<br>he will not hurt you. Come on, to ’t.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1876	1876	1	6	You, sir? Why, what are you?
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1879	1879	1	10	Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1881	1881	1	5	I’ll be with you anon.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1944	1945	2	17	Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll<br>whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1952	1955	4	31	A very dishonest, paltry boy, and more a coward<br>than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his<br>friend here in necessity and denying him; and for<br>his cowardship, ask Fabian.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1959	1960	2	9	Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy<br>sword.
SIR_TOBY	3	4	1963	1963	1	9	I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.
SIR_TOBY	4	1	1991	1992	2	10	Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the<br>house.
SIR_TOBY	4	1	1995	1995	1	4	Come on, sir, hold!
SIR_TOBY	4	1	2001	2003	3	22	Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young<br>soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed.<br>Come on.
SIR_TOBY	4	1	2007	2008	2	17	What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or<br>two of this malapert blood from you.
SIR_TOBY	4	1	2010	2010	1	1	Madam.
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2045	2045	1	5	Jove bless thee, Master Parson.
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2051	2051	1	4	To him, Sir Topas.
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2054	2054	1	7	The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2062	2062	1	4	Well said, Master Parson.
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2098	2098	1	5	My most exquisite Sir Topas!
SIR_TOBY	4	2	2102	2108	7	62	To him in thine own voice, and bring me word<br>how thou find’st him. I would we were well rid<br>of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered,<br>I would he were, for I am now so far in<br>offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with<br>any safety this sport the upshot. Come by and by<br>to my chamber.
SIR_TOBY	5	1	2409	2410	2	20	That’s all one. Has hurt me, and there’s th’ end<br>on ’t. Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?
SIR_TOBY	5	1	2413	2414	2	13	Then he’s a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I<br>hate a drunken rogue.
SIR_TOBY	5	1	2419	2420	2	16	Will you help?—an ass-head, and a coxcomb,<br>and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull?
VALENTINE-TN	1	1	26	34	9	70	So please my lord, I might not be admitted,<br>But from her handmaid do return this answer:<br>The element itself, till seven years’ heat,<br>Shall not behold her face at ample view,<br>But like a cloistress she will veilèd walk,<br>And water once a day her chamber round<br>With eye-offending brine—all this to season<br>A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh<br>And lasting in her sad remembrance.
VALENTINE-TN	1	4	250	253	4	29	If the Duke continue these favors towards<br>you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced. He<br>hath known you but three days, and already you<br>are no stranger.
VALENTINE-TN	1	4	257	257	1	3	No, believe me.
VIOLA	1	2	110	110	1	6	I thank thee. Lead me on.
VIOLA	1	2	44	44	1	5	What country, friends, is this?
VIOLA	1	2	46	49	4	22	And what should I do in Illyria?<br>My brother he is in Elysium.<br>Perchance he is not drowned.—What think you,<br>sailors?
VIOLA	1	2	51	51	1	10	O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.
VIOLA	1	2	62	65	4	26	For saying so, there’s gold.<br>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,<br>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,<br>The like of him. Know’st thou this country?
VIOLA	1	2	68	68	1	3	Who governs here?
VIOLA	1	2	70	70	1	4	What is his name?
VIOLA	1	2	72	73	2	13	Orsino. I have heard my father name him.<br>He was a bachelor then.
VIOLA	1	2	79	79	1	2	What’s she?
VIOLA	1	2	86	89	4	26	O, that I served that lady,<br>And might not be delivered to the world<br>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,<br>What my estate is.
VIOLA	1	2	93	107	15	125	There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,<br>And though that nature with a beauteous wall<br>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee<br>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits<br>With this thy fair and outward character.<br>I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—<br>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid<br>For such disguise as haply shall become<br>The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.<br>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.<br>It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing<br>And speak to him in many sorts of music<br>That will allow me very worth his service.<br>What else may hap, to time I will commit.<br>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
VIOLA	1	4	254	256	3	25	You either fear his humor or my negligence, that<br>you call in question the continuance of his love. Is<br>he inconstant, sir, in his favors?
VIOLA	1	4	258	259	2	12	I thank you.<br>Here comes the Count.
VIOLA	1	4	261	261	1	6	On your attendance, my lord, here.
VIOLA	1	4	269	271	3	21	Sure, my noble lord,<br>If she be so abandoned to her sorrow<br>As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
VIOLA	1	4	274	274	1	10	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
VIOLA	1	4	280	280	1	6	I think not so, my lord.
VIOLA	1	4	293	295	3	21	I’ll do my best<br>To woo your lady. Yet a barful strife!<br>Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.
VIOLA	1	5	461	461	1	9	The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
VIOLA	1	5	463	469	7	66	Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable<br>beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the<br>house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast<br>away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently<br>well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good<br>beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible,<br>even to the least sinister usage.
VIOLA	1	5	471	474	4	38	I can say little more than I have studied, and<br>that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one,<br>give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the<br>house, that I may proceed in my speech.
VIOLA	1	5	476	478	3	27	No, my profound heart. And yet, by the very<br>fangs of malice, I swear I am not that I play. Are<br>you the lady of the house?
VIOLA	1	5	480	484	5	45	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp<br>yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to<br>reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on<br>with my speech in your praise and then show you<br>the heart of my message.
VIOLA	1	5	487	488	2	11	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis<br>poetical.
VIOLA	1	5	496	498	3	18	No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little<br>longer.—Some mollification for your giant, sweet<br>lady.
VIOLA	1	5	500	500	1	4	I am a messenger.
VIOLA	1	5	504	506	3	31	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture<br>of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in<br>my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.
VIOLA	1	5	509	512	4	33	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I<br>learned from my entertainment. What I am and<br>what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your<br>ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.
VIOLA	1	5	516	516	1	3	Most sweet lady—
VIOLA	1	5	519	519	1	3	In Orsino’s bosom.
VIOLA	1	5	521	521	1	11	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
VIOLA	1	5	524	524	1	7	Good madam, let me see your face.
VIOLA	1	5	530	530	1	6	Excellently done, if God did all.
VIOLA	1	5	533	537	5	38	’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white<br>Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.<br>Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive<br>If you will lead these graces to the grave<br>And leave the world no copy.
VIOLA	1	5	545	550	6	40	I see you what you are. You are too proud.<br>But, if you were the devil, you are fair.<br>My lord and master loves you. O, such love<br>Could be but recompensed though you were<br>crowned<br>The nonpareil of beauty.
VIOLA	1	5	552	553	2	13	With adorations, fertile tears,<br>With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
VIOLA	1	5	561	564	4	30	If I did love you in my master’s flame,<br>With such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,<br>In your denial I would find no sense.<br>I would not understand it.
VIOLA	1	5	566	574	9	67	Make me a willow cabin at your gate<br>And call upon my soul within the house,<br>Write loyal cantons of contemnèd love<br>And sing them loud even in the dead of night,<br>Hallow your name to the reverberate hills<br>And make the babbling gossip of the air<br>Cry out <span class="quote" data-words="1">Olivia!</span> O, you should not rest<br>Between the elements of air and earth<br>But you should pity me.
VIOLA	1	5	577	578	2	12	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.<br>I am a gentleman.
VIOLA	1	5	584	588	5	39	I am no fee’d post, lady. Keep your purse.<br>My master, not myself, lacks recompense.<br>Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,<br>And let your fervor, like my master’s, be<br>Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.
VIOLA	2	2	663	664	2	13	Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since<br>arrived but hither.
VIOLA	2	2	672	672	1	10	She took the ring of me. I’ll none of it.
VIOLA	2	2	677	701	25	213	I left no ring with her. What means this lady?<br>Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!<br>She made good view of me, indeed so much<br>That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,<br>For she did speak in starts distractedly.<br>She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion<br>Invites me in this churlish messenger.<br>None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none!<br>I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis,<br>Poor lady, she were better love a dream.<br>Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness<br>Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.<br>How easy is it for the proper false<br>In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!<br>Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,<br>For such as we are made of, such we be.<br>How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,<br>And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,<br>And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.<br>What will become of this? As I am man,<br>My state is desperate for my master’s love.<br>As I am woman (now, alas the day!),<br>What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!<br>O Time, thou must untangle this, not I.<br>It is too hard a knot for me t’ untie.
VIOLA	2	4	1004	1004	1	4	Ay, but I know—
VIOLA	2	4	1006	1010	5	40	Too well what love women to men may owe.<br>In faith, they are as true of heart as we.<br>My father had a daughter loved a man<br>As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,<br>I should your Lordship.
VIOLA	2	4	1012	1020	9	77	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,<br>But let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,<br>Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,<br>And with a green and yellow melancholy<br>She sat like Patience on a monument,<br>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?<br>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed<br>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove<br>Much in our vows but little in our love.
VIOLA	2	4	1022	1024	3	25	I am all the daughters of my father’s house,<br>And all the brothers, too—and yet I know not.<br>Sir, shall I to this lady?
VIOLA	2	4	913	914	2	12	It gives a very echo to the seat<br>Where love is throned.
VIOLA	2	4	919	919	1	5	A little, by your favor.
VIOLA	2	4	921	921	1	3	Of your complexion.
VIOLA	2	4	923	923	1	5	About your years, my lord.
VIOLA	2	4	931	931	1	6	I think it well, my lord.
VIOLA	2	4	936	937	2	17	And so they are. Alas, that they are so,<br>To die even when they to perfection grow!
VIOLA	2	4	986	986	1	7	But if she cannot love you, sir—
VIOLA	2	4	988	992	5	41	Sooth, but you must.<br>Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,<br>Hath for your love as great a pang of heart<br>As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;<br>You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?
VIOLA	3	1	1240	1241	2	12	Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live<br>by thy tabor?
VIOLA	3	1	1243	1243	1	4	Art thou a churchman?
VIOLA	3	1	1247	1249	3	30	So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a<br>beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy<br>tabor if thy tabor stand by the church.
VIOLA	3	1	1253	1254	2	14	Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely with<br>words may quickly make them wanton.
VIOLA	3	1	1257	1257	1	2	Why, man?
VIOLA	3	1	1262	1262	1	3	Thy reason, man?
VIOLA	3	1	1266	1267	2	11	I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car’st for<br>nothing.
VIOLA	3	1	1272	1272	1	7	Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s Fool?
VIOLA	3	1	1278	1278	1	8	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.
VIOLA	3	1	1283	1284	2	19	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with<br>thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee.
VIOLA	3	1	1287	1289	3	27	By my troth I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for<br>one, though I would not have it grow on my<br>chin.—Is thy lady within?
VIOLA	3	1	1291	1291	1	8	Yes, being kept together and put to use.
VIOLA	3	1	1294	1294	1	10	I understand you, sir. ’Tis well begged.
VIOLA	3	1	1300	1308	9	77	This fellow is wise enough to play the Fool,<br>And to do that well craves a kind of wit.<br>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,<br>The quality of persons, and the time,<br>And, like the haggard, check at every feather<br>That comes before his eye. This is a practice<br>As full of labor as a wise man’s art:<br>For folly that he wisely shows is fit;<br>But wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.
VIOLA	3	1	1310	1310	1	3	And you, sir.
VIOLA	3	1	1312	1312	1	5	<span class="foreign" data-words="5" data-lang="fr">Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur! </span>
VIOLA	3	1	1316	1317	2	16	I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the<br>list of my voyage.
VIOLA	3	1	1319	1321	3	19	My legs do better understand me, sir, than I<br>understand what you mean by bidding me taste my<br>legs.
VIOLA	3	1	1323	1326	4	28	I will answer you with gait and entrance—but<br>we are prevented.<br>Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain<br>odors on you!
VIOLA	3	1	1329	1330	2	15	My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own<br>most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
VIOLA	3	1	1336	1336	1	7	My duty, madam, and most humble service.
VIOLA	3	1	1338	1338	1	7	Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.
VIOLA	3	1	1342	1343	2	17	And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.<br>Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.
VIOLA	3	1	1346	1347	2	11	Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts<br>On his behalf.
VIOLA	3	1	1353	1353	1	2	Dear lady—
VIOLA	3	1	1368	1368	1	3	I pity you.
VIOLA	3	1	1370	1371	2	15	No, not a grize, for ’tis a vulgar proof<br>That very oft we pity enemies.
VIOLA	3	1	1381	1383	3	18	Then westward ho!<br>Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship.<br>You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
VIOLA	3	1	1385	1385	1	10	That you do think you are not what you are.
VIOLA	3	1	1387	1387	1	10	Then think you right. I am not what I am.
VIOLA	3	1	1389	1390	2	18	Would it be better, madam, than I am?<br>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
VIOLA	3	1	1404	1409	6	47	By innocence I swear, and by my youth,<br>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,<br>And that no woman has, nor never none<br>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.<br>And so adieu, good madam. Nevermore<br>Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.
VIOLA	3	4	1761	1762	2	13	With the same ’havior that your passion bears<br>Goes on my master’s griefs.
VIOLA	3	4	1768	1768	1	9	Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
VIOLA	3	4	1771	1771	1	4	I will acquit you.
VIOLA	3	4	1775	1775	1	3	And you, sir.
VIOLA	3	4	1782	1784	3	29	You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any<br>quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and<br>clear from any image of offense done to any man.
VIOLA	3	4	1789	1789	1	7	I pray you, sir, what is he?
VIOLA	3	4	1797	1801	5	44	I will return again into the house and desire<br>some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have<br>heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely<br>on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a<br>man of that quirk.
VIOLA	3	4	1810	1813	4	36	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do<br>me this courteous office, as to know of the knight<br>what my offense to him is. It is something of my<br>negligence, nothing of my purpose.
VIOLA	3	4	1816	1816	1	9	Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
VIOLA	3	4	1820	1820	1	9	I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
VIOLA	3	4	1828	1830	3	32	I shall be much bound to you for ’t. I am one<br>that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I<br>care not who knows so much of my mettle.
VIOLA	3	4	1861	1863	3	20	Pray God defend me! A little thing<br>would make me tell them how much I lack of a<br>man.
VIOLA	3	4	1872	1872	1	8	I do assure you ’tis against my will.
VIOLA	3	4	1882	1883	2	9	Pray, sir, put your sword up, if<br>you please.
VIOLA	3	4	1904	1910	7	49	What money, sir?<br>For the fair kindness you have showed me here,<br>And part being prompted by your present trouble,<br>Out of my lean and low ability<br>I’ll lend you something. My having is not much.<br>I’ll make division of my present with you.<br>Hold, there’s half my coffer.
VIOLA	3	4	1917	1922	6	37	I know of none,<br>Nor know I you by voice or any feature.<br>I hate ingratitude more in a man<br>Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,<br>Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption<br>Inhabits our frail blood—
VIOLA	3	4	1940	1943	4	31	Methinks his words do from such passion fly<br>That he believes himself; so do not I.<br>Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,<br>That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!
VIOLA	3	4	1946	1951	6	47	He named Sebastian. I my brother know<br>Yet living in my glass. Even such and so<br>In favor was my brother, and he went<br>Still in this fashion, color, ornament,<br>For him I imitate. O, if it prove,<br>Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!
VIOLA	5	1	2249	2249	1	9	Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
VIOLA	5	1	2265	2267	3	24	He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,<br>But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.<br>I know not what ’twas but distraction.
VIOLA	5	1	2294	2294	1	4	How can this be?
VIOLA	5	1	2308	2308	1	1	Madam?
VIOLA	5	1	2311	2311	1	8	My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
VIOLA	5	1	2338	2339	2	16	And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,<br>To do you rest a thousand deaths would die.
VIOLA	5	1	2341	2345	5	39	After him I love<br>More than I love these eyes, more than my life,<br>More by all mores than e’er I shall love wife.<br>If I do feign, you witnesses above,<br>Punish my life for tainting of my love.
VIOLA	5	1	2347	2347	1	9	Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?
VIOLA	5	1	2355	2355	1	5	No, my lord, not I.
VIOLA	5	1	2382	2382	1	5	My lord, I do protest—
VIOLA	5	1	2400	2402	3	27	Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.<br>You drew your sword upon me without cause,<br>But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.
VIOLA	5	1	2446	2450	5	34	Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.<br>Such a Sebastian was my brother too.<br>So went he suited to his watery tomb.<br>If spirits can assume both form and suit,<br>You come to fright us.
VIOLA	5	1	2457	2457	1	8	My father had a mole upon his brow.
VIOLA	5	1	2459	2460	2	13	And died that day when Viola from her birth<br>Had numbered thirteen years.
VIOLA	5	1	2464	2473	10	77	If nothing lets to make us happy both<br>But this my masculine usurped attire,<br>Do not embrace me till each circumstance<br>Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump<br>That I am Viola; which to confirm,<br>I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,<br>Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help<br>I was preserved to serve this noble count.<br>All the occurrence of my fortune since<br>Hath been between this lady and this lord.
VIOLA	5	1	2484	2487	4	28	And all those sayings will I overswear,<br>And all those swearings keep as true in soul<br>As doth that orbèd continent the fire<br>That severs day from night.
VIOLA	5	1	2490	2493	4	31	The Captain that did bring me first on shore<br>Hath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,<br>Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit,<br>A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.
