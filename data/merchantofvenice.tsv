ANTONIO-MV	1	1	1	7	7	58	In sooth I know not why I am so sad.<br>It wearies me, you say it wearies you.<br>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,<br>I am to learn.<br>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me<br>That I have much ado to know myself.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	117	117	1	10	Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	120	120	1	4	Is that anything now?
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	126	128	3	24	Well, tell me now what lady is the same<br>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br>That you today promised to tell me of?
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	142	146	5	38	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>Within the eye of honor, be assured<br>My purse, my person, my extremest means<br>Lie all unlocked to your occasions.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	160	167	8	69	You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>In making question of my uttermost<br>Than if you had made waste of all I have.<br>Then do but say to me what I should do<br>That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>And I am prest unto it. Therefore speak.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	184	192	9	72	Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;<br>Neither have I money nor commodity<br>To raise a present sum. Therefore go forth:<br>Try what my credit can in Venice do;<br>That shall be racked even to the uttermost<br>To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.<br>Go presently inquire, and so will I,<br>Where money is, and I no question make<br>To have it of my trust, or for my sake.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	42	46	5	40	Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,<br>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>Upon the fortune of this present year:<br>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	48	48	1	2	Fie, fie!
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	65	67	3	24	Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br>I take it your own business calls on you,<br>And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.
ANTONIO-MV	1	1	81	83	3	23	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,<br>A stage where every man must play a part,<br>And mine a sad one.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	389	394	6	37	Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br>By taking nor by giving of excess,<br>Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br>I’ll break a custom. Is he yet<br>possessed<br>How much you would?
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	397	397	1	4	And for three months.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	404	404	1	5	I do never use it.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	409	409	1	8	And what of him? Did he take interest?
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	425	429	5	44	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,<br>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<br>But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.<br>Was this inserted to make interest good?<br>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	432	437	6	40	Mark you this, Bassanio,<br>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose!<br>An evil soul producing holy witness<br>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<br>A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	441	441	1	8	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	466	473	8	63	I am as like to call thee so again,<br>To spet on thee again, to spurn thee, too.<br>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br>As to thy friends, for when did friendship take<br>A breed for barren metal of his friend?<br>But lend it rather to thine enemy,<br>Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face<br>Exact the penalty.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	490	491	2	18	Content, in faith. I’ll seal to such a bond,<br>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	494	497	4	33	Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it!<br>Within these two months—that’s a month before<br>This bond expires—I do expect return<br>Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	509	509	1	8	Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	516	517	2	14	Hie thee, gentle Jew.<br>The Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
ANTONIO-MV	1	3	519	520	2	18	Come on, in this there can be no dismay;<br>My ships come home a month before the day.
ANTONIO-MV	2	6	963	963	1	2	Who’s there?
ANTONIO-MV	2	6	965	969	5	39	Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?<br>’Tis nine o’clock! Our friends all stay for you.<br>No masque tonight; the wind is come about;<br>Bassanio presently will go aboard.<br>I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
ANTONIO-MV	3	3	1695	1695	1	5	Hear me yet, good Shylock—
ANTONIO-MV	3	3	1703	1703	1	6	I pray thee, hear me speak—
ANTONIO-MV	3	3	1712	1717	6	39	Let him alone.<br>I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.<br>He seeks my life. His reason well I know:<br>I oft delivered from his forfeitures<br>Many that have at times made moan to me.<br>Therefore he hates me.
ANTONIO-MV	3	3	1720	1730	11	85	The Duke cannot deny the course of law,<br>For the commodity that strangers have<br>With us in Venice, if it be denied,<br>Will much impeach the justice of the state,<br>Since that the trade and profit of the city<br>Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go.<br>These griefs and losses have so bated me<br>That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh<br>Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.—<br>Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come<br>To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	1911	1911	1	5	Ready, so please your Grace.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	1916	1923	8	57	I have heard<br>Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify<br>His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,<br>And that no lawful means can carry me<br>Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose<br>My patience to his fury, and am armed<br>To suffer with a quietness of spirit<br>The very tyranny and rage of his.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	1980	1993	14	122	I pray you, think you question with the Jew.<br>You may as well go stand upon the beach<br>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<br>You may as well use question with the wolf<br>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<br>You may as well forbid the mountain pines<br>To wag their high tops and to make no noise<br>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;<br>You may as well do anything most hard<br>As seek to soften that than which what’s harder?—<br>His Jewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you<br>Make no more offers, use no farther means,<br>But with all brief and plain conveniency<br>Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2025	2029	5	39	I am a tainted wether of the flock,<br>Meetest for death. The weakest kind of fruit<br>Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.<br>You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,<br>Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2094	2094	1	4	Ay, so he says.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2096	2096	1	2	I do.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2161	2162	2	11	Most heartily I do beseech the court<br>To give the judgment.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2185	2202	18	149	But little. I am armed and well prepared.—<br>Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well.<br>Grieve not that I am fall’n to this for you,<br>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br>Than is her custom: it is still her use<br>To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br>An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance<br>Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br>Commend me to your honorable wife,<br>Tell her the process of Antonio’s end,<br>Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death,<br>And when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br>Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br>Repent but you that you shall lose your friend<br>And he repents not that he pays your debt.<br>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br>I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2305	2315	11	85	So please my lord the Duke and all the court<br>To quit the fine for one half of his goods,<br>I am content, so he will let me have<br>The other half in use, to render it<br>Upon his death unto the gentleman<br>That lately stole his daughter.<br>Two things provided more: that for this favor<br>He presently become a Christian;<br>The other, that he do record a gift,<br>Here in the court, of all he dies possessed<br>Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2340	2341	2	13	And stand indebted, over and above,<br>In love and service to you evermore.
ANTONIO-MV	4	1	2376	2378	3	21	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.<br>Let his deservings and my love withal<br>Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2558	2558	1	8	No more than I am well acquitted of.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2661	2661	1	8	I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2675	2679	5	40	I once did lend my body for his wealth,<br>Which but for him that had your husband’s ring<br>Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,<br>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br>Will never more break faith advisedly.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2682	2682	1	8	Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2706	2706	1	3	I am dumb.
ANTONIO-MV	5	1	2713	2715	3	23	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;<br>For here I read for certain that my ships<br>Are safely come to road.
BALTHAZAR-MV	3	4	1788	1788	1	7	Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
BASSANIO	1	1	121	125	5	48	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,<br>more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as<br>two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you<br>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you<br>have them, they are not worth the search.
BASSANIO	1	1	129	141	13	101	’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br>How much I have disabled mine estate<br>By something showing a more swelling port<br>Than my faint means would grant continuance.<br>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<br>From such a noble rate. But my chief care<br>Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>Wherein my time, something too prodigal,<br>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<br>I owe the most in money and in love,<br>And from your love I have a warranty<br>To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
BASSANIO	1	1	147	159	13	109	In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight<br>The selfsame way with more advisèd watch<br>To find the other forth; and by adventuring both<br>I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof<br>Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>I owe you much, and, like a willful youth,<br>That which I owe is lost. But if you please<br>To shoot another arrow that self way<br>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>As I will watch the aim, or to find both<br>Or bring your latter hazard back again,<br>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
BASSANIO	1	1	168	183	16	119	In Belmont is a lady richly left,<br>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes<br>I did receive fair speechless messages.<br>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<br>To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.<br>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>For the four winds blow in from every coast<br>Renownèd suitors, and her sunny locks<br>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,<br>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,<br>And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>O my Antonio, had I but the means<br>To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>I have a mind presages me such thrift<br>That I should questionless be fortunate!
BASSANIO	1	1	69	71	3	17	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say,<br>when?<br>You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?
BASSANIO	1	1	76	76	1	5	I will not fail you.
BASSANIO	1	3	328	328	1	5	Ay, sir, for three months.
BASSANIO	1	3	330	331	2	11	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall<br>be bound.
BASSANIO	1	3	333	334	2	13	May you stead me? Will you pleasure me?<br>Shall I know your answer?
BASSANIO	1	3	337	337	1	4	Your answer to that?
BASSANIO	1	3	339	340	2	8	Have you heard any imputation to the<br>contrary?
BASSANIO	1	3	354	354	1	4	Be assured you may.
BASSANIO	1	3	358	358	1	8	If it please you to dine with us.
BASSANIO	1	3	366	366	1	4	This is Signior Antonio.
BASSANIO	1	3	379	379	1	4	Shylock, do you hear?
BASSANIO	1	3	480	480	1	3	This were kindness!
BASSANIO	1	3	492	493	2	16	You shall not seal to such a bond for me!<br>I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
BASSANIO	1	3	518	518	1	9	I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.
BASSANIO	2	2	682	686	5	40	You may do so, but let it be<br>so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five<br>of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the<br>liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come<br>anon to my lodging.
BASSANIO	2	2	689	689	1	6	Gramercy. Wouldst thou aught with me?
BASSANIO	2	2	709	709	1	7	One speak for both. What would you?
BASSANIO	2	2	712	716	5	40	I know thee well. Thou hast obtained thy suit.<br>Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,<br>And hath preferred thee, if it be preferment<br>To leave a rich Jew’s service, to become<br>The follower of so poor a gentleman.
BASSANIO	2	2	720	723	4	35	Thou speak’st it well.—Go, father, with thy son.—<br>Take leave of thy old master, and inquire<br>My lodging out. Give him a livery<br>More guarded than his fellows’. See it done.
BASSANIO	2	2	737	740	4	34	I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.<br>These things being bought and orderly bestowed,<br>Return in haste, for I do feast tonight<br>My best esteemed acquaintance. Hie thee, go.
BASSANIO	2	2	745	745	1	1	Gratiano!
BASSANIO	2	2	747	747	1	4	You have obtained it.
BASSANIO	2	2	750	760	11	79	Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,<br>Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice—<br>Parts that become thee happily enough,<br>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.<br>But where thou art not known—why, there they<br>show<br>Something too liberal. Pray thee take pain<br>To allay with some cold drops of modesty<br>Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior<br>I be misconstered in the place I go to,<br>And lose my hopes.
BASSANIO	2	2	770	770	1	6	Well, we shall see your bearing.
BASSANIO	2	2	773	777	5	32	No, that were pity.<br>I would entreat you rather to put on<br>Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends<br>That purpose merriment. But fare you well.<br>I have some business.
BASSANIO	3	2	1377	1378	2	12	Let me choose,<br>For as I am, I live upon the rack.
BASSANIO	3	2	1381	1384	4	33	None but that ugly treason of mistrust,<br>Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.<br>There may as well be amity and life<br>’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
BASSANIO	3	2	1387	1387	1	8	Promise me life and I’ll confess the truth.
BASSANIO	3	2	1389	1393	5	32	<span class="quote" data-words="3">Confess and love</span><br>Had been the very sum of my confession.<br>O happy torment, when my torturer<br>Doth teach me answers for deliverance!<br>But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
BASSANIO	3	2	1427	1462	36	269	So may the outward shows be least themselves;<br>The world is still deceived with ornament.<br>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt<br>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,<br>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,<br>What damnèd error but some sober brow<br>Will bless it and approve it with a text,<br>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<br>There is no vice so simple but assumes<br>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.<br>How many cowards whose hearts are all as false<br>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<br>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,<br>Who inward searched have livers white as milk,<br>And these assume but valor’s excrement<br>To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,<br>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight,<br>Which therein works a miracle in nature,<br>Making them lightest that wear most of it.<br>So are those crispèd snaky golden locks,<br>Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind<br>Upon supposèd fairness, often known<br>To be the dowry of a second head,<br>The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.<br>Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore<br>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf<br>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<br>The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, then, thou gaudy<br>gold,<br>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.<br>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<br>’Tween man and man. But thou, thou meager lead,<br>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,<br>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,<br>And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!
BASSANIO	3	2	1470	1496	35	267	What find I here?<br>Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demigod<br>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<br>Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,<br>Seem they in motion? Here are severed lips<br>Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar<br>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<br>The painter plays the spider, and hath woven<br>A golden mesh t’ entrap the hearts of men<br>Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!<br>How could he see to do them? Having made one,<br>Methinks it should have power to steal both his<br>And leave itself unfurnished. Yet look how far<br>The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br>In underprizing it, so far this shadow<br>Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,<br>The continent and summary of my fortune.<span class="letter" data-words="53"><span class="poem" data-words="53">You that choose not by the view<br>Chance as fair and choose as true.<br>Since this fortune falls to you,<br>Be content and seek no new.<br>If you be well pleased with this<br>And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br>Turn you where your lady is,<br>And claim her with a loving kiss.</span></span><br>A gentle scroll! Fair lady, by your leave,<br>I come by note to give and to receive.<br>Like one of two contending in a prize<br>That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,<br>Hearing applause and universal shout,<br>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>Whether those peals of praise be his or no,<br>So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,<br>As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br>Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.
BASSANIO	3	2	1531	1541	11	83	Madam, you have bereft me of all words.<br>Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,<br>And there is such confusion in my powers<br>As after some oration fairly spoke<br>By a belovèd prince there doth appear<br>Among the buzzing pleasèd multitude,<br>Where every something being blent together<br>Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy<br>Expressed and not expressed. But when this ring<br>Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.<br>O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
BASSANIO	3	2	1551	1551	1	10	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
BASSANIO	3	2	1567	1567	1	7	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
BASSANIO	3	2	1569	1569	1	9	Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.
BASSANIO	3	2	1577	1582	6	35	Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither—<br>If that the youth of my new int’rest here<br>Have power to bid you welcome. By<br>your leave,<br>I bid my very friends and countrymen,<br>Sweet Portia, welcome.
BASSANIO	3	2	1593	1594	2	15	Ere I ope his letter,<br>I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
BASSANIO	3	2	1613	1634	22	167	O sweet Portia,<br>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words<br>That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,<br>When I did first impart my love to you,<br>I freely told you all the wealth I had<br>Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman.<br>And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,<br>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br>How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br>My state was nothing, I should then have told you<br>That I was worse than nothing; for indeed<br>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,<br>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy<br>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,<br>The paper as the body of my friend,<br>And every word in it a gaping wound<br>Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?<br>Hath all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?<br>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,<br>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch<br>Of merchant-marring rocks?
BASSANIO	3	2	1656	1660	5	34	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<br>The best conditioned and unwearied spirit<br>In doing courtesies, and one in whom<br>The ancient Roman honor more appears<br>Than any that draws breath in Italy.
BASSANIO	3	2	1662	1662	1	5	For me, three thousand ducats.
BASSANIO	3	2	1680	1679	7	68	<span class="letter" data-words="68">Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my<br>creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to<br>the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible<br>I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if<br>I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use<br>your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to<br>come, let not my letter.</span>
BASSANIO	3	2	1688	1691	4	34	Since I have your good leave to go away,<br>I will make haste. But till I come again,<br>No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,<br>Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.
BASSANIO	4	1	1973	1974	2	14	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<br>To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
BASSANIO	4	1	1976	1976	1	10	Do all men kill the things they do not love?
BASSANIO	4	1	1978	1978	1	8	Every offence is not a hate at first.
BASSANIO	4	1	1994	1994	1	8	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
BASSANIO	4	1	2022	2024	3	27	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!<br>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all<br>Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood!
BASSANIO	4	1	2032	2032	1	8	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
BASSANIO	4	1	2125	2134	10	82	Yes. Here I tender it for him in the court,<br>Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,<br>I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er<br>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.<br>If this will not suffice, it must appear<br>That malice bears down truth. And I<br>beseech you,<br>Wrest once the law to your authority.<br>To do a great right, do a little wrong,<br>And curb this cruel devil of his will.
BASSANIO	4	1	2203	2208	6	48	Antonio, I am married to a wife<br>Which is as dear to me as life itself,<br>But life itself, my wife, and all the world<br>Are not with me esteemed above thy life.<br>I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<br>Here to this devil, to deliver you.
BASSANIO	4	1	2243	2243	1	4	Here is the money.
BASSANIO	4	1	2260	2260	1	9	I have it ready for thee. Here it is
BASSANIO	4	1	2335	2339	5	35	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend<br>Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted<br>Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof<br>Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew<br>We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
BASSANIO	4	1	2348	2351	4	35	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.<br>Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,<br>Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you:<br>Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
BASSANIO	4	1	2357	2358	2	18	This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle.<br>I will not shame myself to give you this.
BASSANIO	4	1	2361	2364	4	32	There’s more depends on this than on the value.<br>The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<br>And find it out by proclamation.<br>Only for this, I pray you pardon me.
BASSANIO	4	1	2368	2370	3	30	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,<br>And when she put it on, she made me vow<br>That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
BASSANIO	4	1	2379	2384	6	44	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.<br>Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst<br>Unto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste.<br>Come, you and I will thither presently,<br>And in the morning early will we both<br>Fly toward Belmont.—Come, Antonio.
BASSANIO	5	1	2547	2548	2	16	We should hold day with the Antipodes<br>If you would walk in absence of the sun.
BASSANIO	5	1	2553	2555	3	23	I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.<br>This is the man, this is Antonio,<br>To whom I am so infinitely bound.
BASSANIO	5	1	2597	2598	2	18	Why, I were best to cut my left hand off<br>And swear I lost the ring defending it.
BASSANIO	5	1	2607	2609	3	27	If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br>I would deny it, but you see my finger<br>Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.
BASSANIO	5	1	2615	2621	7	54	Sweet Portia,<br>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>If you did know for whom I gave the ring,<br>And would conceive for what I gave the ring,<br>And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>When naught would be accepted but the ring,<br>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
BASSANIO	5	1	2632	2645	14	116	No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,<br>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<br>And begged the ring, the which I did deny him<br>And suffered him to go displeased away,<br>Even he that had held up the very life<br>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>I was enforced to send it after him.<br>I was beset with shame and courtesy.<br>My honor would not let ingratitude<br>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,<br>For by these blessèd candles of the night,<br>Had you been there, I think you would have begged<br>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
BASSANIO	5	1	2664	2667	4	28	Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong,<br>And in the hearing of these many friends<br>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br>Wherein I see myself—
BASSANIO	5	1	2672	2674	3	22	Nay, but hear me.<br>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<br>I never more will break an oath with thee.
BASSANIO	5	1	2683	2683	1	10	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
BASSANIO	5	1	2707	2707	1	9	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
BASSANIO	5	1	2711	2712	2	16	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.<br>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
DUKE-MV	4	1	1910	1910	1	4	What, is Antonio here?
DUKE-MV	4	1	1912	1915	4	27	I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answer<br>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,<br>Uncapable of pity, void and empty<br>From any dram of mercy.
DUKE-MV	4	1	1924	1924	1	9	Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.
DUKE-MV	4	1	1926	1944	19	145	Make room, and let him stand before our face.—<br>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<br>That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice<br>To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,<br>Thou ’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange<br>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<br>And where thou now exacts the penalty,<br>Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,<br>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<br>But, touched with humane gentleness and love,<br>Forgive a moi’ty of the principal,<br>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses<br>That have of late so huddled on his back,<br>Enow to press a royal merchant down<br>And pluck commiseration of his state<br>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<br>From stubborn Turks, and Tartars never trained<br>To offices of tender courtesy.<br>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
DUKE-MV	4	1	1998	1998	1	8	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?
DUKE-MV	4	1	2014	2017	4	24	Upon my power I may dismiss this court<br>Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor<br>Whom I have sent for to determine this,<br>Come here today.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2021	2021	1	7	Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2030	2030	1	6	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
DUKE-MV	4	1	2054	2056	3	17	This letter from Bellario doth commend<br>A young and learnèd doctor to our court.<br>Where is he?
DUKE-MV	4	1	2059	2064	21	205	With all my heart.—Some three or four of you<br>Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<br>Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.<span class="letter" data-words="138">Your Grace shall understand that, at the receipt of<br>your letter, I am very sick, but in the instant that your<br>messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a<br>young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I<br>acquainted him with the cause in controversy between<br>the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o’er<br>many books together. He is furnished with my opinion,<br>which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness<br>whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with<br>him at my importunity to fill up your Grace’s request<br>in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no<br>impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I<br>never knew so young a body with so old a head. I<br>leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial<br>shall better publish his commendation.</span><br>You hear the learnèd Bellario what he writes.<br>And here I take it is the doctor come.—<br>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
DUKE-MV	4	1	2081	2083	3	20	You are welcome. Take your place.<br>Are you acquainted with the difference<br>That holds this present question in the court?
DUKE-MV	4	1	2086	2086	1	7	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2293	2297	5	40	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,<br>I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.<br>For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s;<br>The other half comes to the general state,<br>Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2316	2317	2	16	He shall do this, or else I do recant<br>The pardon that I late pronouncèd here.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2324	2324	1	6	Get thee gone, but do it.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2328	2328	1	9	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
DUKE-MV	4	1	2332	2334	3	23	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.—<br>Antonio, gratify this gentleman,<br>For in my mind you are much bound to him.
GOBBO	2	2	601	602	2	14	Master young man, you, I pray you, which is<br>the way to Master Jew’s?
GOBBO	2	2	606	607	2	13	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is<br>the way to Master Jew’s?
GOBBO	2	2	612	614	3	26	Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.<br>Can you tell me whether one Lancelet, that dwells<br>with him, dwell with him or no?
GOBBO	2	2	618	620	3	27	No master, sir, but a poor man’s son. His<br>father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor<br>man and, God be thanked, well to live.
GOBBO	2	2	623	623	1	6	Your Worship’s friend, and Lancelet, sir.
GOBBO	2	2	626	626	1	7	Of Lancelet, an ’t please your mastership.
GOBBO	2	2	633	634	2	15	Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff<br>of my age, my very prop.
GOBBO	2	2	637	639	3	25	Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.<br>But I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his<br>soul, alive or dead?
GOBBO	2	2	641	641	1	9	Alack, sir, I am sandblind. I know you not.
GOBBO	2	2	649	650	2	14	Pray you, sir, stand up! I am sure you are not<br>Lancelet my boy.
GOBBO	2	2	655	655	1	7	I cannot think you are my son.
GOBBO	2	2	659	663	5	46	Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if<br>thou be Lancelet, thou art mine own flesh and<br>blood. Lord worshiped might He be, what a beard<br>hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin<br>than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
GOBBO	2	2	668	670	3	22	Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou<br>and thy master agree? I have brought him a present.<br>How ’gree you now?
GOBBO	2	2	688	688	1	4	God bless your Worship.
GOBBO	2	2	690	690	1	7	Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy—
GOBBO	2	2	693	694	2	12	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say,<br>to serve—
GOBBO	2	2	697	698	2	11	His master and he (saving your Worship’s<br>reverence) are scarce cater-cousins—
GOBBO	2	2	703	704	2	18	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow<br>upon your Worship, and my suit is—
GOBBO	2	2	711	711	1	9	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
GRATIANO-MV	1	1	114	116	3	18	Well, keep me company but two years more,<br>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own<br>tongue.
GRATIANO-MV	1	1	118	119	2	18	Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable<br>In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
GRATIANO-MV	1	1	77	80	4	30	You look not well, Signior Antonio.<br>You have too much respect upon the world.<br>They lose it that do buy it with much care.<br>Believe me, you are marvelously changed.
GRATIANO-MV	1	1	84	109	27	197	Let me play the fool.<br>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>Why should a man whose blood is warm within<br>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?<br>Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice<br>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio<br>(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):<br>There are a sort of men whose visages<br>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond<br>And do a willful stillness entertain<br>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion<br>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>As who should say <span class="quote" data-words="14">I am Sir Oracle,And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.</span><br>O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>That therefore only are reputed wise<br>For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,<br>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears<br>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers<br>fools.<br>I’ll tell thee more of this another time.<br>But fish not with this melancholy bait<br>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.—<br>Come, good Lorenzo.—Fare you well a while.<br>I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	742	742	1	3	Where’s your master?
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	744	744	1	2	Signior Bassanio!
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	746	746	1	5	I have suit to you.
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	748	749	2	12	You must not deny me. I must go with you<br>to Belmont.
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	761	769	9	70	Signior Bassanio, hear me.<br>If I do not put on a sober habit,<br>Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,<br>Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely,<br>Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes<br>Thus with my hat, and sigh and say <span class="quote" data-words="1">amen,</span><br>Use all the observance of civility<br>Like one well studied in a sad ostent<br>To please his grandam, never trust me more.
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	771	772	2	15	Nay, but I bar tonight. You shall not gauge me<br>By what we do tonight.
GRATIANO-MV	2	2	778	779	2	16	And I must to Lorenzo and the rest.<br>But we will visit you at supper time.
GRATIANO-MV	2	4	804	804	1	6	We have not made good preparation.
GRATIANO-MV	2	4	816	816	1	4	Love news, in faith!
GRATIANO-MV	2	4	832	832	1	7	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	902	903	2	12	This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo<br>Desired us to make stand.
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	905	906	2	15	And it is marvel he outdwells his hour,<br>For lovers ever run before the clock.
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	910	921	12	91	That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast<br>With that keen appetite that he sits down?<br>Where is the horse that doth untread again<br>His tedious measures with the unbated fire<br>That he did pace them first? All things that are,<br>Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.<br>How like a younger or a prodigal<br>The scarfèd bark puts from her native bay,<br>Hugged and embracèd by the strumpet wind;<br>How like the prodigal doth she return<br>With overweathered ribs and raggèd sails,<br>Lean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	954	954	1	9	Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew!
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	964	964	1	2	Signior Antonio?
GRATIANO-MV	2	6	970	971	2	18	I am glad on ’t. I desire no more delight<br>Than to be under sail and gone tonight.
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1545	1550	6	52	My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,<br>I wish you all the joy that you can wish,<br>For I am sure you can wish none from me.<br>And when your honors mean to solemnize<br>The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you<br>Even at that time I may be married too.
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1552	1564	13	102	I thank your Lordship, you have got me one.<br>My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:<br>You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.<br>You loved, I loved; for intermission<br>No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.<br>Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,<br>And so did mine, too, as the matter falls.<br>For wooing here until I sweat again,<br>And swearing till my very roof was dry<br>With oaths of love, at last (if promise last)<br>I got a promise of this fair one here<br>To have her love, provided that your fortune<br>Achieved her mistress.
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1568	1568	1	4	Yes, faith, my lord.
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1570	1571	2	11	We’ll play with them the first boy for a<br>thousand ducats.
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1573	1576	4	35	No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and<br>stake down.<br>But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?<br>What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
GRATIANO-MV	3	2	1598	1602	5	40	Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.—<br>Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?<br>How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?<br>I know he will be glad of our success.<br>We are the Jasons, we have won the Fleece.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2034	2037	4	37	Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,<br>Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,<br>No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness<br>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2039	2049	11	79	O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog,<br>And for thy life let justice be accused;<br>Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,<br>To hold opinion with Pythagoras<br>That souls of animals infuse themselves<br>Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit<br>Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,<br>Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,<br>And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,<br>Infused itself in thee, for thy desires<br>Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2211	2213	3	26	I have a wife who I protest I love.<br>I would she were in heaven, so she could<br>Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2235	2235	1	8	O upright judge!—Mark, Jew.—O learnèd judge!
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2240	2240	1	8	O learnèd judge!—Mark, Jew, a learnèd judge!
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2246	2246	1	8	O Jew, an upright judge, a learnèd judge!
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2256	2257	2	14	A second Daniel! A Daniel, Jew!<br>Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2263	2264	2	17	A Daniel still, say I! A second Daniel!—<br>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2288	2292	5	36	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself!<br>And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br>Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<br>Therefore thou must be hanged at the state’s<br>charge.
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2304	2304	1	8	A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!
GRATIANO-MV	4	1	2325	2327	3	27	In christ’ning shalt thou have two godfathers.<br>Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,<br>To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
GRATIANO-MV	4	2	2390	2393	4	25	Fair sir, you are well o’erta’en.<br>My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice,<br>Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat<br>Your company at dinner.
GRATIANO-MV	4	2	2398	2398	1	4	That will I do.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2562	2565	4	38	By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong!<br>In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.<br>Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<br>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2567	2570	4	32	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<br>That she did give me, whose posy was<br>For all the world like cutler’s poetry<br>Upon a knife, <span class="quote" data-words="6">Love me, and leave me not.</span>
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2579	2579	1	10	He will, an if he live to be a man.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2581	2585	5	43	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<br>A kind of boy, a little scrubbèd boy,<br>No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,<br>A prating boy that begged it as a fee.<br>I could not for my heart deny it him.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2599	2604	6	45	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br>Unto the judge that begged it, and indeed<br>Deserved it, too. And then the boy, his clerk,<br>That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,<br>And neither man nor master would take aught<br>But the two rings.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2659	2660	2	20	Well, do you so. Let not me take him, then,<br>For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2689	2691	3	25	Why, this is like the mending of highways<br>In summer, where the ways are fair enough!<br>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2708	2708	1	10	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
GRATIANO-MV	5	1	2729	2736	8	68	Let it be so. The first inter’gatory<br>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is<br>Whether till the next night she had rather stay<br>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.<br>But were the day come, I should wish it dark<br>Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.<br>Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing<br>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.
JESSICA	2	3	780	788	9	73	I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.<br>Our house is hell and thou, a merry devil,<br>Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.<br>But fare thee well. There is a ducat for thee,<br>And, Lancelet, soon at supper shalt thou see<br>Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.<br>Give him this letter, do it secretly,<br>And so farewell. I would not have my father<br>See me in talk with thee.
JESSICA	2	3	794	800	7	54	Farewell, good Lancelet.<br>Alack, what heinous sin is it in me<br>To be ashamed to be my father’s child?<br>But though I am a daughter to his blood,<br>I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,<br>If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,<br>Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
JESSICA	2	5	854	854	1	6	Call you? What is your will?
JESSICA	2	5	889	889	1	7	His words were <span class="quote" data-words="2">Farewell, mistress,</span> nothing else.
JESSICA	2	5	900	901	2	16	Farewell, and if my fortune be not crossed,<br>I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
JESSICA	2	6	928	929	2	17	Who are you? Tell me for more certainty,<br>Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.
JESSICA	2	6	931	933	3	23	Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed,<br>For who love I so much? And now who knows<br>But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
JESSICA	2	6	935	941	7	58	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.<br>I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,<br>For I am much ashamed of my exchange.<br>But love is blind, and lovers cannot see<br>The pretty follies that themselves commit,<br>For if they could, Cupid himself would blush<br>To see me thus transformèd to a boy.
JESSICA	2	6	943	946	4	30	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?<br>They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.<br>Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love,<br>And I should be obscured.
JESSICA	2	6	952	953	2	18	I will make fast the doors and gild myself<br>With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
JESSICA	3	2	1648	1654	7	56	When I was with him, I have heard him swear<br>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,<br>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh<br>Than twenty times the value of the sum<br>That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,<br>If law, authority, and power deny not,<br>It will go hard with poor Antonio.
JESSICA	3	4	1773	1773	1	7	I wish your Ladyship all heart’s content.
JESSICA	3	5	1827	1827	1	8	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
JESSICA	3	5	1830	1831	2	19	That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so<br>the sins of my mother should be visited upon me!
JESSICA	3	5	1836	1837	2	13	I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made<br>me a Christian.
JESSICA	3	5	1844	1845	2	11	I’ll tell my husband, Lancelet, what you say.<br>Here he comes.
JESSICA	3	5	1848	1853	6	52	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Lancelet<br>and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for<br>me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter; and<br>he says you are no good member of the commonwealth,<br>for in converting Jews to Christians you<br>raise the price of pork.
JESSICA	3	5	1890	1900	11	86	Past all expressing. It is very meet<br>The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,<br>For having such a blessing in his lady<br>He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,<br>And if on earth he do not merit it,<br>In reason he should never come to heaven.<br>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,<br>And on the wager lay two earthly women,<br>And Portia one, there must be something else<br>Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world<br>Hath not her fellow.
JESSICA	3	5	1903	1903	1	8	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!
JESSICA	3	5	1905	1905	1	10	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach!
JESSICA	3	5	1909	1909	1	5	Well, I’ll set you forth.
JESSICA	5	1	2414	2417	4	21	In such a night<br>Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew<br>And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself<br>And ran dismayed away.
JESSICA	5	1	2422	2424	3	14	In such a night<br>Medea gathered the enchanted herbs<br>That did renew old Aeson.
JESSICA	5	1	2429	2432	4	25	In such a night<br>Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,<br>Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,<br>And ne’er a true one.
JESSICA	5	1	2436	2437	2	16	I would out-night you did nobody come,<br>But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

LANCELET	2	2	570	592	31	271	Certainly my conscience will serve me to<br>run from this Jew my master.

Certainly the Jew is the very devil<br>incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience<br>is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel<br>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more<br>friendly counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at<br>your commandment. I will run.
LANCELET	2	2	603	605	3	24	O heavens, this is my true begotten<br>father, who being more than sandblind, high gravelblind,<br>knows me not. I will try confusions with him.

LANCELET	2	2	615	617	3	22	Talk you of young Master Lancelet?<br>Mark me now, now will I raise the waters.—Talk<br>you of young Master Lancelet?
LANCELET	2	2	621	622	2	14	Well, let his father be what he will, we talk<br>of young Master Lancelet.
LANCELET	2	2	624	625	2	17	But I pray you, <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">ergo</span>, old man, <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">ergo</span>, I beseech<br>you, talk you of young Master Lancelet?
LANCELET	2	2	627	632	6	44	<span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">Ergo</span>, Master Lancelet. Talk not of Master<br>Lancelet, father, for the young gentleman, according<br>to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the<br>Sisters Three, and such branches of learning, is<br>indeed deceased, or, as you would say in plain<br>terms, gone to heaven.
LANCELET	2	2	635	636	2	19	Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post,<br>a staff or a prop?—Do you know me, father?
LANCELET	2	2	640	640	1	6	Do you not know me, father?
LANCELET	2	2	642	648	7	62	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might<br>fail of the knowing me. It is a wise father that<br>knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you<br>news of your son. Give me your blessing.<br>Truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid<br>long—a man’s son may, but in the end, truth will<br>out.
LANCELET	2	2	651	654	4	30	Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about<br>it, but give me your blessing. I am Lancelet, your<br>boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall<br>be.
LANCELET	2	2	656	658	3	26	I know not what I shall think of that; but I<br>am Lancelet, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery<br>your wife is my mother.
LANCELET	2	2	664	667	4	30	It should seem, then, that<br>Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had<br>more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I<br>last saw him.
LANCELET	2	2	671	681	11	115	Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have<br>set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I<br>have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew.<br>Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am<br>famished in his service. You may tell every finger I<br>have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come!<br>Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who<br>indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I<br>will run as far as God has any ground. O rare<br>fortune, here comes the man! To him, father, for I<br>am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.
LANCELET	2	2	687	687	1	3	To him, father.
LANCELET	2	2	691	692	2	18	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man,<br>that would, sir, as my father shall specify—
LANCELET	2	2	695	696	2	20	Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the<br>Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify—
LANCELET	2	2	699	702	4	30	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew,<br>having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my<br>father being, I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto<br>you—
LANCELET	2	2	705	708	4	32	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to<br>myself, as your Worship shall know by this honest<br>old man, and though I say it, though old man yet<br>poor man, my father—

Well,<br>if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth<br>offer to swear upon a book—I shall have good<br>fortune, go to! Here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a<br>small trifle of wives—alas, fifteen wives is nothing;<br>eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in<br>for one man—and then to ’scape drowning<br>thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a<br>featherbed! Here are simple ’scapes. Well, if Fortune<br>be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear.<br>Father, come. I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the<br>twinkling.
LANCELET	2	3	789	793	5	38	Adieu. Tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful<br>pagan, most sweet Jew. If a Christian do not<br>play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.<br>But adieu. These foolish drops do something drown<br>my manly spirit. Adieu.
LANCELET	2	4	811	812	2	14	An it shall please you to break up this, it<br>shall seem to signify.
LANCELET	2	4	817	817	1	4	By your leave, sir.
LANCELET	2	4	819	820	2	18	Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to<br>sup tonight with my new master the Christian.
LANCELET	2	5	850	850	1	2	Why, Jessica!
LANCELET	2	5	852	853	2	13	Your Worship was wont to tell me I could<br>do nothing without bidding.
LANCELET	2	5	863	864	2	12	I beseech you, sir, go. My young master<br>doth expect your reproach.
LANCELET	2	5	866	871	6	52	And they have conspired together—I will<br>not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it<br>was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on<br>Black Monday last, at six o’clock i’ th’ morning,<br>falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four<br>year in th’ afternoon.
LANCELET	2	5	884	887	4	28	I will go before, sir. Mistress,<br>look out at window for all this.<br>There will come a Christian by<br>Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.
LANCELET	3	5	1819	1826	8	75	Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father<br>are to be laid upon the children. Therefore I<br>promise you I fear you. I was always plain with you,<br>and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.<br>Therefore be o’ good cheer, for truly I think you<br>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do<br>you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope<br>neither.
LANCELET	3	5	1828	1829	2	18	Marry, you may partly hope that your father<br>got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.
LANCELET	3	5	1832	1835	4	31	Truly, then, I fear you are damned both by<br>father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your<br>father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you<br>are gone both ways.
LANCELET	3	5	1838	1843	6	51	Truly the more to blame he! We were Christians<br>enow before, e’en as many as could well live<br>one by another. This making of Christians will<br>raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork<br>eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the<br>coals for money.
LANCELET	3	5	1857	1859	3	29	It is much that the Moor should be more<br>than reason; but if she be less than an honest<br>woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
LANCELET	3	5	1865	1865	1	8	That is done, sir. They have all stomachs.
LANCELET	3	5	1868	1869	2	10	That is done too, sir, only <span class="quote" data-words="1">cover</span> is the<br>word.
LANCELET	3	5	1871	1871	1	8	Not so, sir, neither! I know my duty.
LANCELET	3	5	1878	1881	4	34	For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for<br>the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in<br>to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humors and conceits<br>shall govern.
LANCELET	5	1	2454	2454	1	7	Sola, sola! Wo ha, ho! Sola, sola!

LEONARDO	2	2	741	741	1	7	My best endeavors shall be done herein.
LEONARDO	2	2	743	743	1	4	Yonder, sir, he walks.
LORENZO	1	1	111	113	3	25	Well, we will leave you then till dinner time.<br>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br>For Gratiano never lets me speak.
LORENZO	1	1	73	75	3	27	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<br>We two will leave you. But at dinner time<br>I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
LORENZO	2	4	801	803	3	19	Nay, we will slink away in supper time,<br>Disguise us at my lodging, and return<br>All in an hour.
LORENZO	2	4	808	810	3	19	’Tis now but four o’clock. We have two hours<br>To furnish us.<br>Friend Lancelet, what’s the news?
LORENZO	2	4	813	815	3	24	I know the hand; in faith, ’tis a fair hand,<br>And whiter than the paper it writ on<br>Is the fair hand that writ.
LORENZO	2	4	818	818	1	3	Whither goest thou?
LORENZO	2	4	821	826	6	36	Hold here, take this. Tell gentle<br>Jessica<br>I will not fail her. Speak it privately.<br>Go, gentlemen,<br>Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?<br>I am provided of a torchbearer.
LORENZO	2	4	829	830	2	10	Meet me and Gratiano<br>At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.
LORENZO	2	4	833	843	11	91	I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed<br>How I shall take her from her father’s house,<br>What gold and jewels she is furnished with,<br>What page’s suit she hath in readiness.<br>If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven,<br>It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;<br>And never dare misfortune cross her foot<br>Unless she do it under this excuse,<br>That she is issue to a faithless Jew.<br>Come, go with me. Peruse this as thou goest;<br>Fair Jessica shall be my torchbearer.
LORENZO	2	6	923	927	5	43	Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.<br>Not I but my affairs have made you wait.<br>When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,<br>I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach.<br>Here dwells my father Jew.—Ho! Who’s within?
LORENZO	2	6	930	930	1	4	Lorenzo, and thy love.
LORENZO	2	6	934	934	1	9	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
LORENZO	2	6	942	942	1	7	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
LORENZO	2	6	947	951	5	32	So are you, sweet,<br>Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.<br>But come at once,<br>For the close night doth play the runaway,<br>And we are stayed for at Bassanio’s feast.
LORENZO	2	6	955	962	8	71	Beshrew me but I love her heartily,<br>For she is wise, if I can judge of her,<br>And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,<br>And true she is, as she hath proved herself.<br>And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,<br>Shall she be placèd in my constant soul.<br>What, art thou come? On, gentleman, away!<br>Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
LORENZO	3	2	1584	1588	5	38	I thank your Honor. For my part, my lord,<br>My purpose was not to have seen you here,<br>But meeting with Salerio by the way,<br>He did entreat me past all saying nay<br>To come with him along.
LORENZO	3	4	1731	1739	9	72	Madam, although I speak it in your presence,<br>You have a noble and a true conceit<br>Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly<br>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.<br>But if you knew to whom you show this honor,<br>How true a gentleman you send relief,<br>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,<br>I know you would be prouder of the work<br>Than customary bounty can enforce you.
LORENZO	3	4	1766	1767	2	13	Madam, with all my heart.<br>I shall obey you in all fair commands.
LORENZO	3	4	1772	1772	1	8	Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
LORENZO	3	5	1846	1847	2	16	I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Lancelet,<br>if you thus get my wife into corners!
LORENZO	3	5	1854	1856	3	26	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth<br>than you can the getting up of the Negro’s<br>belly! The Moor is with child by you, Lancelet.
LORENZO	3	5	1860	1864	5	37	How every fool can play upon the word! I<br>think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into<br>silence, and discourse grow commendable in none<br>only but parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for<br>dinner.
LORENZO	3	5	1866	1867	2	12	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!<br>Then bid them prepare dinner.
LORENZO	3	5	1870	1870	1	5	Will you cover, then, sir?
LORENZO	3	5	1872	1877	6	48	Yet more quarreling with occasion! Wilt<br>thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an<br>instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his<br>plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the<br>table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to<br>dinner.
LORENZO	3	5	1882	1889	8	62	O dear discretion, how his words are suited!<br>The fool hath planted in his memory<br>An army of good words, and I do know<br>A many fools that stand in better place,<br>Garnished like him, that for a tricksy word<br>Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?<br>And now, good sweet, say thy opinion<br>How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?
LORENZO	3	5	1901	1902	2	14	Even such a husband<br>Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
LORENZO	3	5	1904	1904	1	9	I will anon. First let us go to dinner.
LORENZO	3	5	1906	1908	3	20	No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.<br>Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things<br>I shall digest it.
LORENZO	5	1	2408	2413	6	48	The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,<br>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees<br>And they did make no noise, in such a night<br>Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls<br>And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents<br>Where Cressid lay that night.
LORENZO	5	1	2418	2421	4	25	In such a night<br>Stood Dido with a willow in her hand<br>Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love<br>To come again to Carthage.
LORENZO	5	1	2425	2428	4	24	In such a night<br>Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,<br>And with an unthrift love did run from Venice<br>As far as Belmont.
LORENZO	5	1	2433	2435	3	19	In such a night<br>Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,<br>Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
LORENZO	5	1	2438	2438	1	9	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
LORENZO	5	1	2440	2441	2	10	A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you,<br>friend.
LORENZO	5	1	2447	2447	1	4	Who comes with her?
LORENZO	5	1	2450	2453	4	31	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.—<br>But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,<br>And ceremoniously let us prepare<br>Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
LORENZO	5	1	2455	2455	1	2	Who calls?
LORENZO	5	1	2458	2458	1	4	Leave holloaing, man! Here.
LORENZO	5	1	2460	2460	1	1	Here!
LORENZO	5	1	2464	2483	20	159	Let’s in, and there expect their coming.<br>And yet no matter; why should we go in?—<br>My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<br>Within the house, your mistress is at hand,<br>And bring your music forth into the air.<br>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.<br>Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br>Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night<br>Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<br>Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.<br>There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st<br>But in his motion like an angel sings,<br>Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubins.<br>Such harmony is in immortal souls,<br>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.<br>Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn.<br>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,<br>And draw her home with music.
LORENZO	5	1	2485	2504	20	154	The reason is, your spirits are attentive.<br>For do but note a wild and wanton herd<br>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>Which is the hot condition of their blood,<br>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze<br>By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet<br>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and<br>floods,<br>Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br>But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>The man that hath no music in himself,<br>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;<br>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,<br>And his affections dark as Erebus.<br>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
LORENZO	5	1	2527	2528	2	11	That is the voice,<br>Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
LORENZO	5	1	2531	2531	1	4	Dear lady, welcome home.
LORENZO	5	1	2535	2537	3	16	Madam, they are not yet,<br>But there is come a messenger before<br>To signify their coming.
LORENZO	5	1	2542	2543	2	17	Your husband is at hand. I hear his trumpet.<br>We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.
LORENZO	5	1	2722	2723	2	11	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<br>Of starvèd people.
MESSENGER	2	9	1205	1205	1	4	Where is my lady?
MESSENGER	2	9	1208	1217	10	72	Madam, there is alighted at your gate<br>A young Venetian, one that comes before<br>To signify th’ approaching of his lord,<br>From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;<br>To wit (besides commends and courteous breath),<br>Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen<br>So likely an ambassador of love.<br>A day in April never came so sweet,<br>To show how costly summer was at hand,<br>As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
MOROCCO	2	1	521	532	12	95	Mislike me not for my complexion,<br>The shadowed livery of the burnished sun,<br>To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.<br>Bring me the fairest creature northward born,<br>Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,<br>And let us make incision for your love<br>To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.<br>I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine<br>Hath feared the valiant; by my love I swear<br>The best regarded virgins of our clime<br>Have loved it too. I would not change this hue<br>Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
MOROCCO	2	1	543	559	17	127	Even for that I thank you.<br>Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets<br>To try my fortune. By this scimitar<br>That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,<br>That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,<br>I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,<br>Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,<br>Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,<br>Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,<br>To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!<br>If Hercules and Lychas play at dice<br>Which is the better man, the greater throw<br>May turn by fortune from the weaker hand;<br>So is Alcides beaten by his page,<br>And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,<br>Miss that which one unworthier may attain,<br>And die with grieving.
MOROCCO	2	1	565	565	1	9	Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
MOROCCO	2	1	568	569	2	11	Good fortune then,<br>To make me blest—or cursed’st among men!
MOROCCO	2	7	1041	1047	16	104	O hell! What have we here?<br>A carrion death within whose empty eye<br>There is a written scroll.

Men that hazard all<br>Do it in hope of fair advantages.<br>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.<br>I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.<br>What says the silver with her virgin hue?<br><span class="quote" data-words="10">Who chooseth me shall get as much as hedeserves.</span><br>As much as he deserves—pause there, Morocco,<br>And weigh thy value with an even hand.<br>If thou beest rated by thy estimation,<br>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough<br>May not extend so far as to the lady.<br>And yet to be afeard of my deserving<br>Were but a weak disabling of myself.<br>As much as I deserve—why, that’s the lady!<br>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<br>In graces, and in qualities of breeding,<br>But more than these, in love I do deserve.<br>What if I strayed no farther, but chose here?<br>Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold:<br><span class="quote" data-words="9">Who chooseth me shall gain what many mendesire.</span><br>Why, that’s the lady! All the world desires her.<br>From the four corners of the earth they come<br>To kiss this shrine, this mortal, breathing saint.<br>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds<br>Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now<br>For princes to come view fair Portia.<br>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head<br>Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar<br>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come<br>As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.<br>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.<br>Is ’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation<br>To think so base a thought.

Never so rich a gem<br>Was set in worse than gold.

NERISSA	1	2	195	201	7	61	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries<br>were in the same abundance as your good fortunes<br>are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that<br>surfeit with too much as they that starve with<br>nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be<br>seated in the mean. Superfluity comes sooner by<br>white hairs, but competency lives longer.
NERISSA	1	2	203	203	1	7	They would be better if well followed.
NERISSA	1	2	219	227	9	71	Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men<br>at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the<br>lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of<br>gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his<br>meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be<br>chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly<br>love. But what warmth is there in your affection<br>towards any of these princely suitors that are already<br>come?
NERISSA	1	2	231	231	1	6	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
NERISSA	1	2	237	237	1	6	Then is there the County Palatine.
NERISSA	1	2	246	247	2	10	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le<br>Bon?
NERISSA	1	2	258	259	2	11	What say you then to Falconbridge, the young<br>baron of England?
NERISSA	1	2	269	270	2	9	What think you of the Scottish lord, his<br>neighbor?
NERISSA	1	2	276	277	2	11	How like you the young German, the Duke of<br>Saxony’s nephew?
NERISSA	1	2	284	286	3	26	If he should offer to choose, and choose the<br>right casket, you should refuse to perform your<br>father’s will if you should refuse to accept him.
NERISSA	1	2	292	297	6	51	You need not fear, lady, the having any of<br>these lords. They have acquainted me with their<br>determinations, which is indeed to return to their<br>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless<br>you may be won by some other sort than your<br>father’s imposition depending on the caskets.
NERISSA	1	2	304	306	3	26	Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s<br>time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came<br>hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?
NERISSA	1	2	309	311	3	21	True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my<br>foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a<br>fair lady.
NERISSA	2	9	1115	1117	3	23	Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight.<br>The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath<br>And comes to his election presently.
NERISSA	2	9	1202	1203	2	12	The ancient saying is no heresy:<br>Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
NERISSA	2	9	1223	1223	1	8	Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!
NERISSA	3	2	1542	1544	3	28	My lord and lady, it is now our time,<br>That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,<br>To cry <span class="quote" data-words="8">Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!</span>
NERISSA	3	2	1566	1566	1	8	Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
NERISSA	3	2	1572	1572	1	4	What, and stake down?
NERISSA	3	4	1792	1792	1	4	Shall they see us?
NERISSA	3	4	1812	1812	1	6	Why, shall we turn to men?
NERISSA	4	1	2031	2031	1	8	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
NERISSA	4	1	2057	2058	2	13	He attendeth here hard by<br>To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.
NERISSA	4	1	2214	2215	2	16	’Tis well you offer it behind her back.<br>The wish would make else an unquiet house.
NERISSA	4	2	2399	2402	4	27	Sir, I would speak with you.<br>I’ll see if I can get my husband’s<br>ring,<br>Which I did make him swear to keep forever.
NERISSA	4	2	2407	2407	1	10	Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
NERISSA	5	1	2508	2508	1	10	When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
NERISSA	5	1	2514	2514	1	8	It is your music, madam, of the house.
NERISSA	5	1	2517	2517	1	7	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
NERISSA	5	1	2571	2578	8	78	What talk you of the posy or the value?<br>You swore to me when I did give it you<br>That you would wear it till your hour of death,<br>And that it should lie with you in your grave.<br>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br>You should have been respective and have kept it.<br>Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,<br>The clerk will ne’er wear hair on ’s face that had it.
NERISSA	5	1	2580	2580	1	9	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
NERISSA	5	1	2613	2614	2	9	Nor I in yours<br>Till I again see mine!
NERISSA	5	1	2657	2658	2	17	And I his clerk. Therefore be well advised<br>How you do leave me to mine own protection.
NERISSA	5	1	2686	2688	3	24	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,<br>For that same scrubbèd boy, the doctor’s clerk,<br>In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
NERISSA	5	1	2709	2710	2	18	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<br>Unless he live until he be a man.
NERISSA	5	1	2718	2721	4	39	Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.<br>There do I give to you and Jessica,<br>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<br>After his death, of all he dies possessed of.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	193	194	2	13	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary<br>of this great world.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	202	202	1	5	Good sentences, and well pronounced.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	204	218	15	150	If to do were as easy as to know what were<br>good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor<br>men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine<br>that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach<br>twenty what were good to be done than to be one of<br>the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain<br>may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper<br>leaps o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the<br>youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the<br>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to<br>choose me a husband. O, me, the word <span class="quote" data-words="1">choose</span>! I<br>may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I<br>dislike. So is the will of a living daughter curbed by<br>the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that<br>I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
PORTIA-MV	1	2	228	230	3	23	I pray thee, overname them, and as thou<br>namest them, I will describe them, and according<br>to my description level at my affection.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	232	236	5	45	Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but<br>talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation<br>to his own good parts that he can shoe him<br>himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother<br>played false with a smith.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	238	245	8	69	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say<br><span class="quote" data-words="7">An you will not have me, choose.</span> He hears<br>merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the<br>weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so<br>full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had<br>rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in<br>his mouth than to either of these. God defend me<br>from these two!
PORTIA-MV	1	2	248	257	10	97	God made him, and therefore let him pass for<br>a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker,<br>but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the<br>Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than<br>the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a<br>throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will<br>fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I<br>should marry twenty husbands! If he would despise<br>me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to<br>madness, I shall never requite him.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	260	268	9	81	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands<br>not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin,<br>French, nor Italian; and you will come into the<br>court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in<br>the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas,<br>who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly<br>he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy,<br>his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany,<br>and his behavior everywhere.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	271	275	5	42	That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for<br>he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman,<br>and swore he would pay him again when he was<br>able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and<br>sealed under for another.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	278	283	6	60	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober,<br>and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.<br>When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and<br>when he is worst he is little better than a beast. An<br>the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift<br>to go without him.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	287	291	5	49	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set<br>a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary<br>casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation<br>without, I know he will choose it. I will do<br>anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	298	303	6	60	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as<br>chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner<br>of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers<br>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them<br>but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God<br>grant them a fair departure!
PORTIA-MV	1	2	307	308	2	12	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think so was he<br>called.
PORTIA-MV	1	2	312	314	3	19	I remember him well, and I remember him<br>worthy of thy praise.<br>How now, what news?
PORTIA-MV	1	2	319	326	8	70	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good<br>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should<br>be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of<br>a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather<br>he should shrive me than wive me.<br>Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.—<br>Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another<br>knocks at the door.
PORTIA-MV	2	1	533	542	10	75	In terms of choice I am not solely led<br>By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;<br>Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny<br>Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.<br>But if my father had not scanted me<br>And hedged me by his wit to yield myself<br>His wife who wins me by that means I told you,<br>Yourself, renownèd prince, then stood as fair<br>As any comer I have looked on yet<br>For my affection.
PORTIA-MV	2	1	560	564	5	35	You must take your chance<br>And either not attempt to choose at all<br>Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong<br>Never to speak to lady afterward<br>In way of marriage. Therefore be advised.
PORTIA-MV	2	1	566	567	2	12	First, forward to the temple. After dinner<br>Your hazard shall be made.
PORTIA-MV	2	7	1038	1040	3	18	There, take it, prince. And if<br>my form lie there,<br>Then I am yours.
PORTIA-MV	2	7	1057	1058	2	15	A gentle riddance! Draw the curtains, go.<br>Let all of his complexion choose me so.
PORTIA-MV	2	7	972	974	3	22	Go, draw aside the curtains and discover<br>The several caskets to this noble prince.<br>Now make your choice.
PORTIA-MV	2	7	985	986	2	17	The one of them contains my picture, prince.<br>If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1118	1122	5	38	Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince.<br>If you choose that wherein I am contained,<br>Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.<br>But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,<br>You must be gone from hence immediately.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1130	1131	2	14	To these injunctions everyone doth swear<br>That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1171	1171	1	10	Too long a pause for that which you find there.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1180	1181	2	11	To offend and judge are distinct offices<br>And of opposèd natures.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1199	1201	3	24	Thus hath the candle singed the moth.<br>O, these deliberate fools, when they do choose,<br>They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1204	1204	1	5	Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1206	1207	2	5	Here. What would my<br>lord?
PORTIA-MV	2	9	1218	1222	5	42	No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard<br>Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,<br>Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him!<br>Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see<br>Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1353	1376	24	207	I pray you tarry, pause a day or two<br>Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong<br>I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.<br>There’s something tells me (but it is not love)<br>I would not lose you, and you know yourself<br>Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br>But lest you should not understand me well<br>(And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought)<br>I would detain you here some month or two<br>Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.<br>So will I never be. So may you miss me.<br>But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,<br>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>They have o’erlooked me and divided me.<br>One half of me is yours, the other half yours—<br>Mine own, I would say—but if mine, then yours,<br>And so all yours. O, these naughty times<br>Puts bars between the owners and their rights!<br>And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,<br>To eche it, and to draw it out in length,<br>To stay you from election.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1379	1380	2	14	Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess<br>What treason there is mingled with your love.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1385	1386	2	15	Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack<br>Where men enforcèd do speak anything.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1388	1388	1	5	Well, then, confess and live.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1394	1416	23	185	Away, then. I am locked in one of them.<br>If you do love me, you will find me out.—<br>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.<br>Let music sound while he doth make his choice.<br>Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end,<br>Fading in music. That the comparison<br>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br>And wat’ry deathbed for him. He may win,<br>And what is music then? Then music is<br>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>To a new-crownèd monarch. Such it is<br>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear<br>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>With no less presence but with much more love<br>Than young Alcides when he did redeem<br>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice;<br>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>With blearèd visages, come forth to view<br>The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay<br>I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1463	1469	7	49	How all the other passions fleet to air,<br>As doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair,<br>And shudd’ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy!<br>O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,<br>In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!<br>I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less,<br>For fear I surfeit.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1505	1530	26	217	You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<br>Such as I am. Though for myself alone<br>I would not be ambitious in my wish<br>To wish myself much better, yet for you<br>I would be trebled twenty times myself,<br>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times<br>More rich, that only to stand high in your account<br>I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,<br>Exceed account. But the full sum of me<br>Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,<br>Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticed;<br>Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br>But she may learn; happier than this,<br>She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br>Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit<br>Commits itself to yours to be directed<br>As from her lord, her governor, her king.<br>Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours<br>Is now converted. But now I was the lord<br>Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br>Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,<br>This house, these servants, and this same myself<br>Are yours, my lord’s. I give them with this ring,<br>Which, when you part from, lose, or give away,<br>Let it presage the ruin of your love,<br>And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1565	1565	1	4	Is this true, Nerissa?
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1583	1583	1	9	So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1604	1612	9	61	There are some shrewd contents in yond same<br>paper<br>That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.<br>Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world<br>Could turn so much the constitution<br>Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?—<br>With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,<br>And I must freely have the half of anything<br>That this same paper brings you.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1655	1655	1	10	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1661	1661	1	6	What sum owes he the Jew?
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1663	1679	17	131	What, no more?<br>Pay him six thousand and deface the bond.<br>Double six thousand and then treble that,<br>Before a friend of this description<br>Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.<br>First go with me to church and call me wife,<br>And then away to Venice to your friend!<br>For never shall you lie by Portia’s side<br>With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<br>To pay the petty debt twenty times over.<br>When it is paid, bring your true friend along.<br>My maid Nerissa and myself meantime<br>Will live as maids and widows. Come, away,<br>For you shall hence upon your wedding day.<br>Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;<br>Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.<br>But let me hear the letter of your friend.
PORTIA-MV	3	2	1687	1687	1	7	O love, dispatch all business and begone!
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1740	1765	26	186	I never did repent for doing good,<br>Nor shall not now; for in companions<br>That do converse and waste the time together,<br>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,<br>There must be needs a like proportion<br>Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;<br>Which makes me think that this Antonio,<br>Being the bosom lover of my lord,<br>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,<br>How little is the cost I have bestowed<br>In purchasing the semblance of my soul<br>From out the state of hellish cruelty!<br>This comes too near the praising of myself;<br>Therefore no more of it. Hear other things:<br>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands<br>The husbandry and manage of my house<br>Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,<br>I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow<br>To live in prayer and contemplation,<br>Only attended by Nerissa here,<br>Until her husband and my lord’s return.<br>There is a monastery two miles off,<br>And there we will abide. I do desire you<br>Not to deny this imposition,<br>The which my love and some necessity<br>Now lays upon you.
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1768	1771	4	29	My people do already know my mind<br>And will acknowledge you and Jessica<br>In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.<br>So fare you well till we shall meet again.
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1774	1787	14	116	I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased<br>To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.<br>Now, Balthazar,<br>As I have ever found thee honest true,<br>So let me find thee still: take this same letter,<br>And use thou all th’ endeavor of a man<br>In speed to Padua. See thou render this<br>Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario.<br>And look what notes and garments he doth give<br>thee,<br>Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed<br>Unto the traject, to the common ferry<br>Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,<br>But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1789	1791	3	23	Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand<br>That you yet know not of. We’ll see our husbands<br>Before they think of us.
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1793	1811	19	152	They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit<br>That they shall think we are accomplishèd<br>With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,<br>When we are both accoutered like young men,<br>I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,<br>And wear my dagger with the braver grace,<br>And speak between the change of man and boy<br>With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps<br>Into a manly stride, and speak of frays<br>Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies<br>How honorable ladies sought my love,<br>Which I denying, they fell sick and died—<br>I could not do withal!—then I’ll repent,<br>And wish, for all that, that I had not killed them.<br>And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,<br>That men shall swear I have discontinued school<br>Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind<br>A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks<br>Which I will practice.
PORTIA-MV	3	4	1813	1818	6	46	Fie, what a question’s that,<br>If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!<br>But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device<br>When I am in my coach, which stays for us<br>At the park gate; and therefore haste away,<br>For we must measure twenty miles today.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2080	2080	1	4	I did, my lord.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2084	2085	2	16	I am informèd throughly of the cause.<br>Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2087	2087	1	4	Is your name Shylock?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2089	2093	5	34	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,<br>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<br>You stand within his danger, do you<br>not?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2095	2095	1	5	Do you confess the bond?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2097	2097	1	6	Then must the Jew be merciful.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2099	2121	23	172	The quality of mercy is not strained.<br>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:<br>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.<br>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes<br>The thronèd monarch better than his crown.<br>His scepter shows the force of temporal power,<br>The attribute to awe and majesty<br>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>But mercy is above this sceptered sway.<br>It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings;<br>It is an attribute to God Himself;<br>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s<br>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br>Though justice be thy plea, consider this:<br>That in the course of justice none of us<br>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,<br>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,<br>Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant<br>there.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2124	2124	1	8	Is he not able to discharge the money?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2135	2139	5	37	It must not be. There is no power in Venice<br>Can alter a decree establishèd;<br>’Twill be recorded for a precedent<br>And many an error by the same example<br>Will rush into the state. It cannot be.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2142	2142	1	9	I pray you let me look upon the bond.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2144	2144	1	7	Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2148	2152	5	38	Why, this bond is forfeit,<br>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br>Nearest the merchant’s heart.—Be merciful;<br>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2163	2164	2	13	Why, then, thus it is:<br>You must prepare your bosom for his knife—
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2166	2168	3	21	For the intent and purpose of the law<br>Hath full relation to the penalty,<br>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2171	2171	1	5	Therefore lay bare your bosom—
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2175	2176	2	11	It is so.<br>Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2178	2179	2	18	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<br>To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2181	2182	2	17	It is not so expressed, but what of that?<br>’Twere good you do so much for charity.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2184	2184	1	7	You, merchant, have you anything to say?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2209	2210	2	19	Your wife would give you little thanks for that<br>If she were by to hear you make the offer.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2221	2222	2	19	A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine:<br>The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2224	2225	2	19	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:<br>The law allows it, and the court awards it.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2227	2234	8	65	Tarry a little. There is something else.<br>This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.<br>The words expressly are <span class="quote" data-words="4">a pound of flesh.</span><br>Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,<br>But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br>One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br>Are by the laws of Venice confiscate<br>Unto the state of Venice.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2237	2239	3	20	Thyself shalt see the act.<br>For, as thou urgest justice, be assured<br>Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2244	2245	2	17	Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft, no haste!<br>He shall have nothing but the penalty.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2247	2255	9	80	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.<br>Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more<br>But just a pound of flesh. If thou tak’st more<br>Or less than a just pound, be it but so much<br>As makes it light or heavy in the substance<br>Or the division of the twentieth part<br>Of one poor scruple—nay, if the scale do turn<br>But in the estimation of a hair,<br>Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2258	2258	1	8	Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2261	2262	2	16	He hath refused it in the open court.<br>He shall have merely justice and his bond.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2266	2267	2	15	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture<br>To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2270	2287	18	125	Tarry, Jew.<br>The law hath yet another hold on you.<br>It is enacted in the laws of Venice,<br>If it be proved against an alien<br>That by direct or indirect attempts<br>He seek the life of any citizen,<br>The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive<br>Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<br>Comes to the privy coffer of the state,<br>And the offender’s life lies in the mercy<br>Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice.<br>In which predicament I say thou stand’st,<br>For it appears by manifest proceeding<br>That indirectly, and directly too,<br>Thou hast contrived against the very life<br>Of the defendant, and thou hast incurred<br>The danger formerly by me rehearsed.<br>Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2298	2298	1	7	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2303	2303	1	7	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2318	2318	1	8	Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2320	2320	1	6	Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2329	2331	3	23	I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon.<br>I must away this night toward Padua,<br>And it is meet I presently set forth.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2342	2347	6	47	He is well paid that is well satisfied,<br>And I, delivering you, am satisfied,<br>And therein do account myself well paid.<br>My mind was never yet more mercenary.<br>I pray you know me when we meet again.<br>I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2352	2356	5	48	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.<br>Give me your gloves; I’ll wear them for your sake—<br>And for your love I’ll take this ring from you.<br>Do not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more,<br>And you in love shall not deny me this.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2359	2360	2	17	I will have nothing else but only this.<br>And now methinks I have a mind to it.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2365	2367	3	26	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.<br>You taught me first to beg, and now methinks<br>You teach me how a beggar should be answered.
PORTIA-MV	4	1	2371	2375	5	43	That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.<br>And if your wife be not a madwoman,<br>And know how well I have deserved this ring,<br>She would not hold out enemy forever<br>For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you.
PORTIA-MV	4	2	2385	2389	5	38	Inquire the Jew’s house out; give him this deed<br>And let him sign it.  We’ll<br>away tonight,<br>And be a day before our husbands home.<br>This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
PORTIA-MV	4	2	2394	2397	4	27	That cannot be.<br>His ring I do accept most thankfully,<br>And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore,<br>I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.
PORTIA-MV	4	2	2403	2406	4	35	Thou mayst, I warrant! We shall have old swearing<br>That they did give the rings away to men;<br>But we’ll outface them, and outswear them, too.—<br>Away, make haste! Thou know’st where I will tarry.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2505	2507	3	26	That light we see is burning in my hall.<br>How far that little candle throws his beams!<br>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2509	2513	5	38	So doth the greater glory dim the less.<br>A substitute shines brightly as a king<br>Until a king be by, and then his state<br>Empties itself as doth an inland brook<br>Into the main of waters. Music, hark!
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2515	2516	2	15	Nothing is good, I see, without respect.<br>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2518	2526	9	65	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark<br>When neither is attended, and I think<br>The nightingale, if she should sing by day<br>When every goose is cackling, would be thought<br>No better a musician than the wren.<br>How many things by season seasoned are<br>To their right praise and true perfection!<br>Peace—how the moon sleeps with Endymion<br>And would not be awaked!
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2529	2530	2	14	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,<br>By the bad voice.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2532	2534	3	20	We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,<br>Which speed we hope the better for our words.<br>Are they returned?
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2538	2541	4	26	Go in, Nerissa.<br>Give order to my servants that they take<br>No note at all of our being absent hence—<br>Nor you, Lorenzo—Jessica, nor you.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2544	2546	3	26	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;<br>It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day<br>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2549	2552	4	36	Let me give light, but let me not be light,<br>For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,<br>And never be Bassanio so for me.<br>But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2556	2557	2	20	You should in all sense be much bound to him,<br>For as I hear he was much bound for you.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2559	2561	3	22	Sir, you are very welcome to our house.<br>It must appear in other ways than words;<br>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2566	2566	1	7	A quarrel ho, already! What’s the matter?
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2586	2596	11	103	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,<br>To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,<br>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,<br>And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br>I gave my love a ring and made him swear<br>Never to part with it, and here he stands.<br>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<br>Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth<br>That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.<br>An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2605	2606	2	15	What ring gave you, my lord?<br>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2610	2612	3	23	Even so void is your false heart of truth.<br>By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed<br>Until I see the ring!
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2622	2631	10	81	If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>Or your own honor to contain the ring,<br>You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>If you had pleased to have defended it<br>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<br>I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring!
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2646	2656	11	95	Let not that doctor e’er come near my house!<br>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<br>And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br>I will become as liberal as you:<br>I’ll not deny him anything I have,<br>No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.<br>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.<br>Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus.<br>If you do not, if I be left alone,<br>Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,<br>I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2662	2663	2	8	Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome<br>notwithstanding.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2668	2671	4	27	Mark you but that!<br>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,<br>In each eye one. Swear by your double self,<br>And there’s an oath of credit.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2680	2681	2	22	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,<br>And bid him keep it better than the other.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2684	2685	2	17	I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,<br>For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2692	2705	14	116	Speak not so grossly.—You are all amazed.<br>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.<br>It comes from Padua from Bellario.<br>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<br>Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here<br>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,<br>And even but now returned. I have not yet<br>Entered my house.—Antonio, you are welcome,<br>And I have better news in store for you<br>Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon.<br>There you shall find three of your argosies<br>Are richly come to harbor suddenly.<br>You shall not know by what strange accident<br>I chancèd on this letter.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2716	2717	2	12	How now, Lorenzo?<br>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
PORTIA-MV	5	1	2724	2728	5	35	It is almost morning,<br>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br>Of these events at full. Let us go in,<br>And charge us there upon inter’gatories,<br>And we will answer all things faithfully.
SALARINO	1	1	23	41	19	154	My wind cooling my broth<br>Would blow me to an ague when I thought<br>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.<br>I should not see the sandy hourglass run<br>But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,<br>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs<br>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>And see the holy edifice of stone<br>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,<br>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>And, in a word, but even now worth this<br>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>But tell not me: I know Antonio<br>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
SALARINO	1	1	63	64	2	17	I would have stayed till I had made you merry,<br>If worthier friends had not prevented me.
SALARINO	1	1	68	68	1	5	Good morrow, my good lords.
SALARINO	1	1	72	72	1	8	We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.
SALARINO	1	1	8	14	7	52	Your mind is tossing on the ocean,<br>There where your argosies with portly sail<br>(Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea)<br>Do overpeer the petty traffickers<br>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br>As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SALARINO	2	4	805	805	1	8	We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
SALARINO	2	4	827	827	1	8	Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.
SALARINO	2	4	831	831	1	5	’Tis good we do so.
SALARINO	2	6	904	904	1	5	His hour is almost past.
SALARINO	2	6	907	909	3	21	O, ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly<br>To seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont<br>To keep obligèd faith unforfeited.
SALARINO	2	6	922	922	1	7	Here comes Lorenzo. More of this hereafter.
SALARINO	2	8	1059	1061	3	23	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;<br>With him is Gratiano gone along;<br>And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
SALARINO	2	8	1064	1069	6	42	He came too late; the ship was under sail.<br>But there the Duke was given to understand<br>That in a gondola were seen together<br>Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.<br>Besides, Antonio certified the Duke<br>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
SALARINO	2	8	1082	1083	2	16	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,<br>Crying <span class="quote" data-words="7">His stones, his daughter, and his ducats.</span>
SALARINO	2	8	1086	1092	7	48	Marry, well remembered.<br>I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday<br>Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part<br>The French and English, there miscarrièd<br>A vessel of our country richly fraught.<br>I thought upon Antonio when he told me,<br>And wished in silence that it were not his.
SALARINO	2	8	1095	1102	15	115	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.<br>I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.<br>Bassanio told him he would make some speed<br>Of his return. He answered <span class="quote" data-words="58">Do not so.Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,<br>But stay the very riping of the time;<br>And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,<br>Let it not enter in your mind of love.<br>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts<br>To courtship and such fair ostents of love<br>As shall conveniently become you there.</span><br>And even there, his eye being big with tears,<br>Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,<br>And with affection wondrous sensible<br>He wrung Bassanio’s hand—and so they parted.
SALARINO	2	8	1114	1114	1	3	Do we so.
SALARINO	3	1	1225	1231	7	57	Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio<br>hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the<br>Narrow Seas—the Goodwins, I think they call the<br>place—a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the<br>carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say,<br>if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her<br>word.
SALARINO	3	1	1239	1239	1	4	Come, the full stop.
SALARINO	3	1	1242	1242	1	10	I would it might prove the end of his losses.
SALARINO	3	1	1250	1251	2	16	That’s certain. I for my part knew the tailor<br>that made the wings she flew withal.
SALARINO	3	1	1256	1256	1	9	That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.
SALARINO	3	1	1261	1265	5	42	There is more difference between thy flesh<br>and hers than between jet and ivory, more between<br>your bloods than there is between red wine and<br>Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio<br>have had any loss at sea or no?
SALARINO	3	1	1273	1274	2	17	Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not<br>take his flesh! What’s that good for?
SALARINO	3	1	1298	1298	1	9	We have been up and down to seek him.
SALERIO	3	2	1589	1592	4	20	I did, my lord,<br>And I have reason for it.<br>Signior Antonio<br>Commends him to you.
SALERIO	3	2	1595	1597	3	22	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,<br>Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there<br>Will show you his estate.
SALERIO	3	2	1603	1603	1	11	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
SALERIO	3	2	1635	1647	13	99	Not one, my lord.<br>Besides, it should appear that if he had<br>The present money to discharge the Jew,<br>He would not take it. Never did I know<br>A creature that did bear the shape of man<br>So keen and greedy to confound a man.<br>He plies the Duke at morning and at night,<br>And doth impeach the freedom of the state<br>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,<br>The Duke himself, and the magnificoes<br>Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,<br>But none can drive him from the envious plea<br>Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
SALERIO	4	1	1925	1925	1	10	He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.
SALERIO	4	1	2018	2020	3	16	My lord, here stays without<br>A messenger with letters from the doctor,<br>New come from Padua.
SERVINGMAN	1	2	315	318	4	35	The four strangers seek for you, madam,<br>to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come<br>from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings<br>word the Prince his master will be here tonight.
SERVINGMAN	3	1	1296	1297	2	15	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his<br>house and desires to speak with you both.
SHYLOCK	1	3	327	327	1	4	Three thousand ducats, well.
SHYLOCK	1	3	329	329	1	4	For three months, well.
SHYLOCK	1	3	332	332	1	5	Antonio shall become bound, well.
SHYLOCK	1	3	335	336	2	9	Three thousand ducats for three months,<br>and Antonio bound.
SHYLOCK	1	3	338	338	1	5	Antonio is a good man.
SHYLOCK	1	3	341	353	13	113	Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he<br>is a good man is to have you understand me that he<br>is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he<br>hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the<br>Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto,<br>he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and<br>other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But<br>ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land<br>rats and water rats, water thieves and land<br>thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the<br>peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,<br>notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats.<br>I think I may take his bond.
SHYLOCK	1	3	355	357	3	21	I will be assured I may. And that I may be<br>assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with<br>Antonio?
SHYLOCK	1	3	359	365	7	59	Yes, to smell pork! To eat of the habitation<br>which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the<br>devil into! I will buy with you, sell with you, talk<br>with you, walk with you, and so following; but I<br>will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with<br>you.—What news on the Rialto?—Who is he comes<br>here?
SHYLOCK	1	3	367	378	12	93	How like a fawning publican he looks!<br>I hate him for he is a Christian,<br>But more for that in low simplicity<br>He lends out money gratis and brings down<br>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<br>If I can catch him once upon the hip,<br>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.<br>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,<br>Even there where merchants most do congregate,<br>On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,<br>Which he calls <span class="quote" data-words="1">interest.</span> Cursèd be my tribe<br>If I forgive him!
SHYLOCK	1	3	380	388	9	64	I am debating of my present store,<br>And, by the near guess of my memory,<br>I cannot instantly raise up the gross<br>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?<br>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,<br>Will furnish me. But soft, how many months<br>Do you desire? Rest you fair, good<br>signior!<br>Your Worship was the last man in our mouths.
SHYLOCK	1	3	395	396	2	5	Ay, ay, three thousand<br>ducats.
SHYLOCK	1	3	398	403	6	32	I had forgot—three months.<br>You told me so.—<br>Well then, your bond. And let me see—but hear<br>you:<br>Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow<br>Upon advantage.
SHYLOCK	1	3	405	408	4	30	When Jacob grazed his Uncle Laban’s sheep—<br>This Jacob from our holy Abram was<br>(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)<br>The third possessor; ay, he was the third—
SHYLOCK	1	3	410	424	15	118	No, not take interest, not, as you would say,<br>Directly <span class="quote" data-words="1">interest.</span> Mark what Jacob did.<br>When Laban and himself were compromised<br>That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied<br>Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank<br>In end of autumn turnèd to the rams,<br>And when the work of generation was<br>Between these woolly breeders in the act,<br>The skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands,<br>And in the doing of the deed of kind<br>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<br>Who then conceiving did in eaning time<br>Fall parti-colored lambs, and those were Jacob’s.<br>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;<br>And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.
SHYLOCK	1	3	430	431	2	13	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.<br>But note me, signior—
SHYLOCK	1	3	438	440	3	18	Three thousand ducats. ’Tis a good round sum.<br>Three months from twelve, then let me see, the<br>rate—
SHYLOCK	1	3	442	460	24	185	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br>In the Rialto you have rated me<br>About my moneys and my usances.<br>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug<br>(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe).<br>You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,<br>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br>And all for use of that which is mine own.<br>Well then, it now appears you need my help.<br>Go to, then. You come to me and you say<br><span class="quote" data-words="5">Shylock, we would have moneys</span>—you say so,<br>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,<br>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur<br>Over your threshold. Moneys is your suit.<br>What should I say to you? Should I not say<br><span class="quote" data-words="14">Hath a dog money? Is it possibleA cur can lend three thousand ducats?</span> Or<br>Shall I bend low, and in a bondman’s key,<br>With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,<br>Say this: <span class="quote" data-words="31">Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesdaylast;<br>You spurned me such a day; another time<br>You called me <span class="quote" data-words="1">dog</span>; and for these courtesies<br>I’ll lend you thus much moneys</span>?
SHYLOCK	1	3	474	479	6	48	Why, look you how you storm!<br>I would be friends with you and have your love,<br>Forget the shames that you have stained me with,<br>Supply your present wants, and take no doit<br>Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me!<br>This is kind I offer.
SHYLOCK	1	3	481	489	9	72	This kindness will I show.<br>Go with me to a notary, seal me there<br>Your single bond; and in a merry sport,<br>If you repay me not on such a day,<br>In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br>Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit<br>Be nominated for an equal pound<br>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<br>In what part of your body pleaseth me.
SHYLOCK	1	3	498	508	11	90	O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect<br>The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:<br>If he should break his day, what should I gain<br>By the exaction of the forfeiture?<br>A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man<br>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,<br>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,<br>To buy his favor I extend this friendship.<br>If he will take it, so. If not, adieu;<br>And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
SHYLOCK	1	3	510	515	6	42	Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.<br>Give him direction for this merry bond,<br>And I will go and purse the ducats straight,<br>See to my house left in the fearful guard<br>Of an unthrifty knave, and presently<br>I’ll be with you.
SHYLOCK	2	5	844	849	6	43	Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,<br>The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—<br>What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize<br>As thou hast done with me—what, Jessica!—<br>And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.—<br>Why, Jessica, I say!
SHYLOCK	2	5	851	851	1	10	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
SHYLOCK	2	5	855	862	8	66	I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.<br>There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?<br>I am not bid for love. They flatter me.<br>But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon<br>The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl,<br>Look to my house.—I am right loath to go.<br>There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,<br>For I did dream of money bags tonight.
SHYLOCK	2	5	865	865	1	4	So do I his.
SHYLOCK	2	5	872	883	12	96	What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica,<br>Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum<br>And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,<br>Clamber not you up to the casements then,<br>Nor thrust your head into the public street<br>To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,<br>But stop my house’s ears (I mean my casements).<br>Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter<br>My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear<br>I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.<br>But I will go.—Go you before me, sirrah.<br>Say I will come.
SHYLOCK	2	5	888	888	1	8	What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?
SHYLOCK	2	5	890	899	10	77	The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,<br>Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day<br>More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me,<br>Therefore I part with him, and part with him<br>To one that I would have him help to waste<br>His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.<br>Perhaps I will return immediately.<br>Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you.<br>Fast bind, fast find—<br>A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1248	1249	2	14	You knew, none so well, none so well as you,<br>of my daughter’s flight.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1255	1255	1	5	She is damned for it.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1257	1257	1	7	My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SHYLOCK	3	1	1260	1260	1	10	I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1266	1272	7	66	There I have another bad match! A bankrout,<br>a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on<br>the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug<br>upon the mart! Let him look to his bond. He was<br>wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He<br>was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let<br>him look to his bond.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1275	1295	21	194	To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else,<br>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and<br>hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,<br>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted<br>my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies—<br>and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not<br>a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,<br>senses, affections, passions? Fed with the<br>same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to<br>the same diseases, healed by the same means,<br>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer<br>as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not<br>bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you<br>poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall<br>we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will<br>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,<br>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong<br>a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian<br>example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I<br>will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the<br>instruction.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1302	1303	2	12	How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?<br>Hast thou found my daughter?
SHYLOCK	3	1	1306	1319	14	129	Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond<br>gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt!<br>The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I<br>never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that,<br>and other precious, precious jewels! I would my<br>daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her<br>ear; would she were hearsed at my foot and the<br>ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And<br>I know not what’s spent in the search! Why, thou<br>loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so<br>much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no<br>revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a’ my<br>shoulders, no sighs but a’ my breathing, no tears but<br>a’ my shedding.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1322	1322	1	7	What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
SHYLOCK	3	1	1325	1325	1	12	I thank God, I thank God! Is it true, is it true?
SHYLOCK	3	1	1328	1329	2	14	I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good<br>news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa—
SHYLOCK	3	1	1332	1334	3	20	Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never<br>see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting,<br>fourscore ducats!
SHYLOCK	3	1	1338	1339	2	17	I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll<br>torture him. I am glad of it.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1342	1345	4	32	Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It<br>was my turquoise! I had it of Leah when I was a<br>bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness<br>of monkeys.
SHYLOCK	3	1	1347	1352	6	55	Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal,<br>fee me an officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before. I<br>will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he<br>out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.<br>Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good<br>Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.
SHYLOCK	3	3	1692	1694	3	22	Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.<br>This is the fool that lent out money gratis.<br>Jailer, look to him.
SHYLOCK	3	3	1696	1702	7	63	I’ll have my bond. Speak not against my bond.<br>I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.<br>Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,<br>But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.<br>The Duke shall grant me justice.—I do wonder,<br>Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond<br>To come abroad with him at his request.
SHYLOCK	3	3	1704	1709	6	51	I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.<br>I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.<br>I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,<br>To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield<br>To Christian intercessors. Follow not!<br>I’ll have no speaking. I will have my bond.
SHYLOCK	4	1	1945	1972	28	228	I have possessed your Grace of what I purpose,<br>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br>To have the due and forfeit of my bond.<br>If you deny it, let the danger light<br>Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!<br>You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have<br>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br>Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,<br>But say it is my humor. Is it answered?<br>What if my house be troubled with a rat,<br>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats<br>To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?<br>Some men there are love not a gaping pig,<br>Some that are mad if they behold a cat,<br>And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,<br>Cannot contain their urine; for affection<br>Masters oft passion, sways it to the mood<br>Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:<br>As there is no firm reason to be rendered<br>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,<br>Why he a harmless necessary cat,<br>Why he a woolen bagpipe, but of force<br>Must yield to such inevitable shame<br>As to offend, himself being offended,<br>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing<br>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br>A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
SHYLOCK	4	1	1975	1975	1	10	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
SHYLOCK	4	1	1977	1977	1	9	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
SHYLOCK	4	1	1979	1979	1	9	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
SHYLOCK	4	1	1995	1997	3	26	If every ducat in six thousand ducats<br>Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,<br>I would not draw them. I would have my bond.
SHYLOCK	4	1	1999	2010	15	131	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<br>You have among you many a purchased slave,<br>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,<br>You use in abject and in slavish parts<br>Because you bought them. Shall I say to you<br><span class="quote" data-words="32">Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds<br>Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates<br>Be seasoned with such viands</span>? You will answer<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">The slaves are ours!</span> So do I answer you:<br>The pound of flesh which I demand of him<br>Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.<br>If you deny me, fie upon your law:<br>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<br>I stand for judgment. Answer: shall I have it?
SHYLOCK	4	1	2033	2033	1	8	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2038	2038	1	9	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2050	2053	4	36	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,<br>Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.<br>Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall<br>To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2088	2088	1	4	Shylock is my name.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2098	2098	1	8	On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2122	2123	2	16	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2140	2141	2	17	A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel.<br>O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!
SHYLOCK	4	1	2143	2143	1	8	Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2145	2147	3	21	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven!<br>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br>No, not for Venice!
SHYLOCK	4	1	2153	2160	8	64	When it is paid according to the tenor.<br>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br>You know the law; your exposition<br>Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,<br>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br>Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear<br>There is no power in the tongue of man<br>To alter me. I stay here on my bond.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2165	2165	1	7	O noble judge! O excellent young man!
SHYLOCK	4	1	2169	2170	2	17	’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,<br>How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
SHYLOCK	4	1	2172	2174	3	20	Ay, his breast!<br>So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">Nearest his heart.</span> Those are the very words.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2177	2177	1	4	I have them ready.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2180	2180	1	7	Is it so nominated in the bond?
SHYLOCK	4	1	2183	2183	1	9	I cannot find it. ’Tis not in the bond.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2216	2220	5	32	These be the Christian husbands! I have a<br>daughter—<br>Would any of the stock of Barabbas<br>Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!<br>We trifle time. I pray thee, pursue sentence.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2223	2223	1	3	Most rightful judge!
SHYLOCK	4	1	2226	2226	1	7	Most learnèd judge! A sentence!—Come, prepare.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2236	2236	1	4	Is that the law?
SHYLOCK	4	1	2241	2242	2	14	I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice<br>And let the Christian go.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2259	2259	1	8	Give me my principal and let me go.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2265	2265	1	7	Shall I not have barely my principal?
SHYLOCK	4	1	2268	2269	2	14	Why, then, the devil give him good of it!<br>I’ll stay no longer question.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2299	2302	4	37	Nay, take my life and all. Pardon not that.<br>You take my house when you do take the prop<br>That doth sustain my house; you take my life<br>When you do take the means whereby I live.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2319	2319	1	3	I am content.
SHYLOCK	4	1	2321	2323	3	24	I pray you give me leave to go from hence.<br>I am not well. Send the deed after me<br>And I will sign it.
SOLANIO	1	1	15	22	8	61	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br>The better part of my affections would<br>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,<br>Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br>And every object that might make me fear<br>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>Would make me sad.
SOLANIO	1	1	47	47	1	6	Why then you are in love.
SOLANIO	1	1	49	62	14	111	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad<br>Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy<br>For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry<br>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed<br>Janus,<br>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:<br>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes<br>And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper,<br>And other of such vinegar aspect<br>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile<br>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.<br>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br>Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare you well.<br>We leave you now with better company.
SOLANIO	2	4	806	807	2	15	’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered,<br>And better in my mind not undertook.
SOLANIO	2	4	828	828	1	4	And so will I.
SOLANIO	2	8	1062	1063	2	16	The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,<br>Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
SOLANIO	2	8	1070	1073	12	89	I never heard a passion so confused,<br>So strange, outrageous, and so variable<br>As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.<br><span class="quote" data-words="67">My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!Fled with a Christian!

SOLANIO	2	8	1084	1085	2	14	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,<br>Or he shall pay for this.
SOLANIO	2	8	1093	1094	2	18	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear—<br>Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
SOLANIO	2	8	1110	1113	4	29	I think he only loves the world for him.<br>I pray thee, let us go and find him out<br>And quicken his embracèd heaviness<br>With some delight or other.
SOLANIO	3	1	1224	1224	1	6	Now, what news on the Rialto?
SOLANIO	3	1	1232	1238	7	64	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as<br>ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe<br>she wept for the death of a third husband. But<br>it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing<br>the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,<br>the honest Antonio—O, that I had a title good<br>enough to keep his name company!—
SOLANIO	3	1	1240	1241	2	13	Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he<br>hath lost a ship.
SOLANIO	3	1	1243	1247	5	31	Let me say <span class="quote" data-words="1">amen</span> betimes, lest the devil<br>cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness<br>of a Jew.<br>How now, Shylock, what news among the<br>merchants?
SOLANIO	3	1	1252	1254	3	24	And Shylock for his own part knew the bird<br>was fledge, and then it is the complexion of them<br>all to leave the dam.
SOLANIO	3	1	1258	1259	2	10	Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these<br>years?
SOLANIO	3	1	1299	1301	3	17	Here comes another of the tribe; a third<br>cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn<br>Jew.
SOLANIO	3	3	1710	1711	2	11	It is the most impenetrable cur<br>That ever kept with men.
SOLANIO	3	3	1718	1719	2	12	I am sure the Duke<br>Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
STEPHANO-MV	5	1	2439	2439	1	2	A friend.
STEPHANO-MV	5	1	2442	2446	5	36	Stephano is my name, and I bring word<br>My mistress will before the break of day<br>Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about<br>By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays<br>For happy wedlock hours.
STEPHANO-MV	5	1	2448	2449	2	16	None but a holy hermit and her maid.<br>I pray you, is my master yet returned?
TUBAL	3	1	1304	1305	2	13	I often came where I did hear of her, but<br>cannot find her.
TUBAL	3	1	1320	1321	2	13	Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio, as I<br>heard in Genoa—
TUBAL	3	1	1323	1324	2	8	—hath an argosy cast away coming from<br>Tripolis.
TUBAL	3	1	1326	1327	2	11	I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped<br>the wrack.
TUBAL	3	1	1330	1331	2	12	Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one<br>night fourscore ducats.
TUBAL	3	1	1335	1337	3	18	There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my<br>company to Venice that swear he cannot choose<br>but break.
TUBAL	3	1	1340	1341	2	16	One of them showed me a ring that he had of<br>your daughter for a monkey.
TUBAL	3	1	1346	1346	1	5	But Antonio is certainly undone.
