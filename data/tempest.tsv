ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	721	721	1	7	Though this island seem to be desert—
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	724	724	1	4	Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	726	726	1	1	Yet—
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	728	729	2	10	It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate<br>temperance.
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	733	733	1	8	The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	761	762	2	12	Tunis was never graced before with such a<br>paragon to their queen.
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	768	770	3	17	<span class="quote" data-words="2">Widow Dido,</span> said you? You<br>make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of<br>Tunis.
ADRIAN-TMP	2	1	772	772	1	1	Carthage?
ADRIAN-TMP	3	3	1669	1669	1	4	Follow, I pray you.
ALONSO	1	1	9	10	2	10	Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the Master?<br>Play the men.
ALONSO	2	1	1037	1038	2	13	Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?<br>Wherefore this ghastly looking?
ALONSO	2	1	1044	1044	1	3	I heard nothing.
ALONSO	2	1	1048	1048	1	4	Heard you this, Gonzalo?
ALONSO	2	1	1055	1056	2	13	Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search<br>For my poor son.
ALONSO	2	1	1059	1059	1	2	Lead away.
ALONSO	2	1	694	694	1	2	Prithee, peace.
ALONSO	2	1	711	711	1	3	I prithee, spare.
ALONSO	2	1	796	803	8	65	You cram these words into mine ears against<br>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never<br>Married my daughter there, for coming thence<br>My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,<br>Who is so far from Italy removed<br>I ne’er again shall see her.—O, thou mine heir<br>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish<br>Hath made his meal on thee?
ALONSO	2	1	814	814	1	4	No, no, he’s gone.
ALONSO	2	1	820	820	1	2	Prithee, peace.
ALONSO	2	1	830	830	1	7	So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.
ALONSO	2	1	872	872	1	9	Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.
ALONSO	2	1	892	894	3	24	What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes<br>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find<br>They are inclined to do so.
ALONSO	2	1	902	902	1	4	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
ALONSO	3	3	1542	1548	7	60	Old lord, I cannot blame thee.<br>Who am myself attached with weariness<br>To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.<br>Even here I will put off my hope and keep it<br>No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned<br>Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks<br>Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
ALONSO	3	3	1559	1559	1	8	What harmony is this? My good friends, hark.
ALONSO	3	3	1561	1561	1	8	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
ALONSO	3	3	1581	1585	5	26	I cannot too much muse<br>Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound,<br>expressing—<br>Although they want the use of tongue—a kind<br>Of excellent dumb discourse.
ALONSO	3	3	1592	1592	1	2	Not I.
ALONSO	3	3	1602	1605	4	29	I will stand to and feed.<br>Although my last, no matter, since I feel<br>The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,<br>Stand to, and do as we.
ALONSO	3	3	1652	1659	8	63	O, it is monstrous, monstrous!<br>Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;<br>The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,<br>That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced<br>The name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.<br>Therefor my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded, and<br>I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,<br>And with him there lie mudded.
ALONSO	5	1	2087	2097	11	82	Whe’er thou be’st he or no,<br>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me<br>(As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse<br>Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,<br>Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which<br>I fear a madness held me. This must crave,<br>An if this be at all, a most strange story.<br>Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat<br>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should<br>Prospero<br>Be living and be here?
ALONSO	5	1	2119	2124	6	41	If thou be’st Prospero,<br>Give us particulars of thy preservation,<br>How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since<br>Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost—<br>How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—<br>My dear son Ferdinand.
ALONSO	5	1	2126	2127	2	12	Irreparable is the loss, and patience<br>Says it is past her cure.
ALONSO	5	1	2132	2132	1	4	You the like loss?
ALONSO	5	1	2137	2142	6	38	A daughter?<br>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,<br>The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish<br>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed<br>Where my son lies!—When did you lose your<br>daughter?
ALONSO	5	1	2169	2171	3	15	If this prove<br>A vision of the island, one dear son<br>Shall I twice lose.
ALONSO	5	1	2175	2178	4	18	Now, all the<br>blessings<br>Of a glad father compass thee about!<br>Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.
ALONSO	5	1	2184	2187	4	30	What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?<br>Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.<br>Is she the goddess that hath severed us<br>And brought us thus together?
ALONSO	5	1	2197	2199	3	17	I am hers.<br>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I<br>Must ask my child forgiveness!
ALONSO	5	1	2209	2209	1	4	I say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Amen,</span> Gonzalo.
ALONSO	5	1	2219	2222	4	18	Give me your<br>hands.<br>Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart<br>That doth not wish you joy!
ALONSO	5	1	2238	2240	3	16	These are not natural events. They strengthen<br>From strange to stranger.—Say, how came you<br>hither?
ALONSO	5	1	2257	2260	4	29	This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,<br>And there is in this business more than nature<br>Was ever conduct of. Some oracle<br>Must rectify our knowledge.
ALONSO	5	1	2297	2297	1	7	Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
ALONSO	5	1	2299	2301	3	24	And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they<br>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?<br>How cam’st thou in this pickle?
ALONSO	5	1	2310	2310	1	11	This is as strange a thing as e’er I looked on.
ALONSO	5	1	2320	2320	1	9	Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
ALONSO	5	1	2334	2336	3	15	I long<br>To hear the story of your life, which must<br>Take the ear strangely.
ANTONIO-TMP	1	1	12	12	1	5	Where is the Master, boatswain?
ANTONIO-TMP	1	1	44	46	3	17	Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent<br>noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than<br>thou art.
ANTONIO-TMP	1	1	57	59	3	22	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.<br>This wide-chopped rascal—would thou<br>mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
ANTONIO-TMP	1	1	66	66	1	6	Let’s all sink wi’ th’ King.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	1001	1015	15	126	Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,<br>’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not<br>This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences<br>That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they<br>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,<br>No better than the earth he lies upon.<br>If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead—<br>Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,<br>Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,<br>To the perpetual wink for aye might put<br>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who<br>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,<br>They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.<br>They’ll tell the clock to any business that<br>We say befits the hour.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	1021	1023	3	17	Draw together,<br>And when I rear my hand, do you the like<br>To fall it on Gonzalo.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	1034	1034	1	6	Then let us both be sudden.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	1045	1047	3	24	O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,<br>To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar<br>Of a whole herd of lions.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	697	697	1	8	The visitor will not give him o’er so.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	710	710	1	9	Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	714	715	2	13	Which, of he or Adrian,<br>for a good wager, first begins to crow?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	717	717	1	2	The cockerel.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	719	719	1	2	A laughter.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	722	722	1	3	Ha, ha, ha.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	727	727	1	5	He could not miss ’t.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	730	730	1	5	Temperance was a delicate wench.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	735	735	1	7	Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	737	737	1	5	True, save means to live.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	741	741	1	5	The ground indeed is tawny.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	743	743	1	4	He misses not much.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	752	753	2	14	If but one of his pockets could speak, would<br>it not say he lies?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	764	765	2	12	Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that <span class="quote" data-words="1">widow</span><br>in? Widow Dido!
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	774	774	1	8	His word is more than the miraculous harp.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	776	777	2	8	What impossible matter will he make easy<br>next?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	780	781	2	13	And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring<br>forth more islands.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	783	783	1	4	Why, in good time.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	788	788	1	7	And the rarest that e’er came there.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	790	790	1	6	O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	793	793	1	6	That <span class="quote" data-words="1">sort</span> was well fished for.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	836	836	1	3	And most chirurgeonly.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	840	840	1	2	Very foul.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	842	842	1	6	He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	857	858	2	9	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets<br>the beginning.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	866	866	1	7	None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	870	870	1	3	Long live Gonzalo!
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	877	877	1	5	’Twas you we laughed at.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	881	881	1	6	What a blow was there given!
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	887	887	1	7	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	891	891	1	5	Go sleep, and hear us.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	899	901	3	17	We two, my lord,<br>Will guard your person while you take your rest,<br>And watch your safety.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	904	904	1	7	It is the quality o’ th’ climate.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	908	915	8	56	Nor I. My spirits are nimble.<br>They fell together all, as by consent.<br>They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,<br>Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more.<br>And yet methinks I see it in thy face<br>What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and<br>My strong imagination sees a crown<br>Dropping upon thy head.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	917	917	1	6	Do you not hear me speak?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	924	926	3	14	Noble Sebastian,<br>Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st<br>Whiles thou art waking.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	929	931	3	21	I am more serious than my custom. You<br>Must be so too, if heed me; which to do<br>Trebles thee o’er.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	933	933	1	6	I’ll teach you how to flow.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	936	941	6	40	O,<br>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish<br>Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it<br>You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed<br>Most often do so near the bottom run<br>By their own fear or sloth.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	946	953	8	51	Thus, sir:<br>Although this lord of weak remembrance—this,<br>Who shall be of as little memory<br>When he is earthed—hath here almost persuaded—<br>For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only<br>Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive,<br>’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned<br>As he that sleeps here swims.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	956	961	6	43	O, out of that no hope<br>What great hope have you! No hope that way is<br>Another way so high a hope that even<br>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,<br>But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me<br>That Ferdinand is drowned?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	963	964	2	9	Then tell me,<br>Who’s the next heir of Naples?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	966	974	9	74	She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells<br>Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples<br>Can have no note, unless the sun were post—<br>The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins<br>Be rough and razorable; she that from whom<br>We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,<br>And by that destiny to perform an act<br>Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come<br>In yours and my discharge.
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	979	988	12	97	A space whose ev’ry cubit<br>Seems to cry out <span class="quote" data-words="16">How shall that ClaribelMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis<br>And let Sebastian wake.</span> Say this were death<br>That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse<br>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples<br>As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate<br>As amply and unnecessarily<br>As this Gonzalo. I myself could make<br>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore<br>The mind that I do, what a sleep were this<br>For your advancement! Do you understand me?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	992	993	2	10	And how does your content<br>Tender your own good fortune?
ANTONIO-TMP	2	1	996	999	4	26	True,<br>And look how well my garments sit upon me,<br>Much feater than before. My brother’s servants<br>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
ANTONIO-TMP	3	3	1549	1551	3	23	I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.<br>Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose<br>That you resolved t’ effect.
ANTONIO-TMP	3	3	1554	1557	4	24	Let it be tonight;<br>For now they are oppressed with travel, they<br>Will not nor cannot use such vigilance<br>As when they are fresh.
ANTONIO-TMP	3	3	1566	1569	4	28	I’ll believe both;<br>And what does else want credit, come to me<br>And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie,<br>Though fools at home condemn ’em.
ANTONIO-TMP	3	3	1662	1662	1	4	I’ll be thy second.
ANTONIO-TMP	5	1	2284	2285	2	13	Very like. One of them<br>Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.
ARIEL			523	522	13	55	<span class="song" data-words="55">Come unto these yellow sands,<br>And then take hands.<br>Curtsied when you have, and kissed<br>The wild waves whist.<br>Foot it featly here and there,<br>And sweet sprites bear<br>The burden.

ARIEL	1	2	295	299	5	41	All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come<br>To answer thy best pleasure. Be ’t to fly,<br>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride<br>On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task<br>Ariel and all his quality.
ARIEL	1	2	302	313	12	86	To every article.<br>I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,<br>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,<br>I flamed amazement. Sometimes I’d divide<br>And burn in many places. On the topmast,<br>The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,<br>Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors<br>O’ th’ dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary<br>And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks<br>Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune<br>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,<br>Yea, his dread trident shake.
ARIEL	1	2	317	323	8	61	Not a soul<br>But felt a fever of the mad, and played<br>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners<br>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,<br>Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand,<br>With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—<br>Was the first man that leaped; cried <span class="quote" data-words="9">Hell is empty,And all the devils are here.</span>
ARIEL	1	2	327	327	1	4	Close by, my master.
ARIEL	1	2	329	336	8	61	Not a hair perished.<br>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,<br>But fresher than before; and, as thou bad’st me,<br>In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.<br>The King’s son have I landed by himself,<br>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs<br>In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,<br>His arms in this sad knot.
ARIEL	1	2	340	351	12	87	Safely in harbor<br>Is the King’s ship. In the deep nook, where once<br>Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew<br>From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she’s hid;<br>The mariners all under hatches stowed,<br>Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,<br>I have left asleep. And for the rest o’ th’ fleet,<br>Which I dispersed, they all have met again<br>And are upon the Mediterranean float,<br>Bound sadly home for Naples,<br>Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wracked<br>And his great person perish.
ARIEL	1	2	355	355	1	4	Past the mid season.
ARIEL	1	2	358	360	3	24	Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,<br>Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,<br>Which is not yet performed me.
ARIEL	1	2	363	363	1	2	My liberty.
ARIEL	1	2	365	369	5	31	I prithee,<br>Remember I have done thee worthy service,<br>Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, served<br>Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise<br>To bate me a full year.
ARIEL	1	2	372	372	1	1	No.
ARIEL	1	2	378	378	1	4	I do not, sir.
ARIEL	1	2	382	382	1	2	No, sir.
ARIEL	1	2	384	384	1	3	Sir, in Argier.
ARIEL	1	2	392	392	1	2	Ay, sir.
ARIEL	1	2	409	409	1	4	Yes, Caliban, her son.
ARIEL	1	2	419	419	1	4	I thank thee, master.
ARIEL	1	2	423	425	3	13	Pardon, master.<br>I will be correspondent to command<br>And do my spriting gently.
ARIEL	1	2	428	429	2	14	That’s my noble master.<br>What shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do?
ARIEL	1	2	453	453	1	6	My lord, it shall be done.
ARIEL	1	2	683	683	1	3	To th’ syllable.
ARIEL	2	1	1025	1027	9	57	My master through his art foresees the danger<br>That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth—<br>For else his project dies—to keep them living.<span class="song" data-words="26">While you here do snoring lie,<br>Open-eyed conspiracy<br>His time doth take.<br>If of life you keep a care,<br>Shake off slumber and beware.<br>Awake, awake!</span>

ARIEL	3	2	1419	1419	1	2	Thou liest.
ARIEL	3	2	1439	1439	1	5	Thou liest. Thou canst not.
ARIEL	3	2	1452	1452	1	2	Thou liest.
ARIEL	3	2	1497	1497	1	6	This will I tell my master.
ARIEL	3	3	1606	1637	32	247	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,<br>That hath to instrument this lower world<br>And what is in ’t, the never-surfeited sea<br>Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island,<br>Where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men<br>Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;<br>And even with such-like valor, men hang and drown<br>Their proper selves.<br>You fools, I and my fellows<br>Are ministers of Fate. The elements<br>Of whom your swords are tempered may as well<br>Wound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs<br>Kill the still-closing waters as diminish<br>One dowl that’s in my plume. My fellow ministers<br>Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,<br>Your swords are now too massy for your strengths<br>And will not be uplifted. But remember—<br>For that’s my business to you—that you three<br>From Milan did supplant good Prospero,<br>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,<br>Him and his innocent child, for which foul deed,<br>The powers—delaying, not forgetting—have<br>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures<br>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,<br>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me<br>Ling’ring perdition, worse than any death<br>Can be at once, shall step by step attend<br>You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you<br>from—<br>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls<br>Upon your heads—is nothing but heart’s sorrow<br>And a clear life ensuing.
ARIEL	4	1	1706	1706	1	8	What would my potent master? Here I am.
ARIEL	4	1	1715	1715	1	1	Presently?
ARIEL	4	1	1717	1716	5	33	<span class="poem" data-words="33">Before you can say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Come</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">Go,</span><br>And breathe twice, and cry <span class="quote" data-words="2">So, so,</span><br>Each one, tripping on his toe,<br>Will be here with mop and mow.<br>Do you love me, master? No?</span>
ARIEL	4	1	1724	1724	1	3	Well; I conceive.
ARIEL	4	1	1852	1852	1	8	Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?
ARIEL	4	1	1855	1857	3	23	Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,<br>I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared<br>Lest I might anger thee.
ARIEL	4	1	1859	1874	16	112	I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,<br>So full of valor that they smote the air<br>For breathing in their faces, beat the ground<br>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending<br>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,<br>At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their<br>ears,<br>Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses<br>As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears<br>That, calf-like, they my lowing followed through<br>Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and<br>thorns,<br>Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them<br>I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,<br>There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake<br>O’erstunk their feet.
ARIEL	4	1	1879	1879	1	4	I go, I go.
ARIEL	4	1	1952	1952	1	5	Silver! There it goes, Silver!
ARIEL	4	1	1959	1959	1	3	Hark, they roar.
ARIEL	5	1	1968	1969	2	15	On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,<br>You said our work should cease.
ARIEL	5	1	1973	1988	16	96	Confined<br>together<br>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,<br>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,<br>In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.<br>They cannot budge till your release. The King,<br>His brother, and yours abide all three distracted,<br>And the remainder mourning over them,<br>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly<br>Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord<br>Gonzalo.<br>His tears runs down his beard like winter’s drops<br>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works<br>’em<br>That if you now beheld them, your affections<br>Would become tender.
ARIEL	5	1	1990	1990	1	6	Mine would, sir, were I human.
ARIEL	5	1	2005	2005	1	4	I’ll fetch them, sir.

ARIEL	5	1	2076	2077	2	14	I drink the air before me, and return<br>Or ere your pulse twice beat.
ARIEL	5	1	2235	2236	2	10	Sir, all this service<br>Have I done since I went.
ARIEL	5	1	2255	2255	1	4	Was ’t well done?
BOATSWAIN	1	1	11	11	1	5	I pray now, keep below.
BOATSWAIN	1	1	13	14	2	17	Do you not hear him? You mar our labor.<br>Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm.
BOATSWAIN	1	1	16	18	3	20	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these<br>roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence!<br>Trouble us not.
BOATSWAIN	1	1	2	2	1	4	Here, master. What cheer?
BOATSWAIN	1	1	21	28	8	72	None that I more love than myself. You are<br>a councillor; if you can command these elements<br>to silence, and work the peace of the present, we<br>will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If<br>you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and<br>make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance<br>of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good<br>hearts!—Out of our way, I say!
BOATSWAIN	1	1	35	40	6	55	Down with the topmast! Yare! Lower, lower!<br>Bring her to try wi’ th’ main course.<br>A plague upon this howling! They are<br>louder than the weather or our office.<br>Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o’er and<br>drown? Have you a mind to sink?
BOATSWAIN	1	1	43	43	1	3	Work you, then.
BOATSWAIN	1	1	5	8	4	27	Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my<br>hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th’<br>Master’s whistle.—Blow till thou burst thy wind, if<br>room enough!
BOATSWAIN	1	1	50	51	2	15	Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses.<br>Off to sea again! Lay her off!
BOATSWAIN	1	1	53	53	1	6	What, must our mouths be cold?
BOATSWAIN	5	1	2230	2234	5	41	The best news is that we have safely found<br>Our king and company. The next: our ship,<br>Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split,<br>Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when<br>We first put out to sea.
BOATSWAIN	5	1	2241	2254	14	96	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,<br>I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep<br>And—how, we know not—all clapped under<br>hatches,<br>Where, but even now, with strange and several<br>noises<br>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,<br>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,<br>We were awaked, straightway at liberty,<br>Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld<br>Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master<br>Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,<br>Even in a dream were we divided from them<br>And were brought moping hither.
CALIBAN	1	2	448	448	1	4	There’s wood enough within.
CALIBAN	1	2	456	459	4	28	As wicked dew as e’er my mother brushed<br>With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen<br>Drop on you both. A southwest blow on you<br>And blister you all o’er.
CALIBAN	1	2	466	482	17	131	I must eat my dinner.<br>This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother,<br>Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,<br>Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst<br>give me<br>Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how<br>To name the bigger light and how the less,<br>That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee,<br>And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,<br>The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and<br>fertile.<br>Cursed be I that did so! All the charms<br>Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,<br>For I am all the subjects that you have,<br>Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me<br>In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me<br>The rest o’ th’ island.
CALIBAN	1	2	490	492	3	21	O ho, O ho! Would ’t had been done!<br>Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else<br>This isle with Calibans.
CALIBAN	1	2	508	510	3	25	You taught me language, and my profit on ’t<br>Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you<br>For learning me your language!
CALIBAN	1	2	518	521	4	26	No, pray thee.<br>I must obey. His art is of such power<br>It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,<br>And make a vassal of him.
CALIBAN	2	2	1062	1078	17	144	All the infections that the sun sucks up<br>From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<br>By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me,<br>And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,<br>Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ th’ mire,<br>Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark<br>Out of my way, unless he bid ’em. But<br>For every trifle are they set upon me,<br>Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me<br>And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which<br>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount<br>Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I<br>All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues<br>Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!<br>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me<br>For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat.<br>Perchance he will not mind me.
CALIBAN	2	2	1118	1118	1	5	Do not torment me! O!
CALIBAN	2	2	1126	1126	1	5	The spirit torments me. O!
CALIBAN	2	2	1134	1135	2	11	Do not torment me, prithee. I’ll bring my<br>wood home faster.
CALIBAN	2	2	1142	1144	3	21	Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt<br>anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper<br>works upon thee.

CALIBAN	2	2	1190	1191	2	16	I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true<br>subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
CALIBAN	2	2	1203	1203	1	6	Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
CALIBAN	2	2	1206	1208	3	22	I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.<br>My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy<br>bush.

CALIBAN	2	2	1234	1239	6	54	I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,<br>And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,<br>Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how<br>To snare the nimble marmoset.

CALIBAN	3	2	1412	1413	2	20	I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased<br>to harken once again to the suit I made to thee?
CALIBAN	3	2	1416	1418	3	23	As I told thee before, I am subject<br>to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath<br>cheated me of the island.
CALIBAN	3	2	1420	1422	3	20	Thou liest, thou jesting monkey,<br>thou. I would my valiant master would<br>destroy thee. I do not lie.
CALIBAN	3	2	1429	1432	4	31	I say by sorcery he got this isle;<br>From me he got it. If thy Greatness will,<br>Revenge it on him, for I know thou dar’st,<br>But this thing dare not.
CALIBAN	3	2	1434	1434	1	10	Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.
CALIBAN	3	2	1437	1438	2	18	Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep,<br>Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
CALIBAN	3	2	1440	1444	5	41	What a pied ninny’s this!—Thou scurvy patch!—<br>I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows<br>And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone,<br>He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him<br>Where the quick freshes are.

CALIBAN	3	2	1462	1463	2	11	Beat him enough. After a little time<br>I’ll beat him too.
CALIBAN	3	2	1466	1482	17	139	Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him<br>I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,<br>Having first seized his books, or with a log<br>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,<br>Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember<br>First to possess his books, for without them<br>He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not<br>One spirit to command. They all do hate him<br>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.<br>He has brave utensils—for so he calls them—<br>Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.<br>And that most deeply to consider is<br>The beauty of his daughter. He himself<br>Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman<br>But only Sycorax my dam and she;<br>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax<br>As great’st does least.
CALIBAN	3	2	1484	1485	2	15	Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,<br>And bring thee forth brave brood.
CALIBAN	3	2	1494	1495	2	13	Within this half hour will he be asleep.<br>Wilt thou destroy him then?

CALIBAN	3	2	1516	1516	1	3	Art thou afeard?
CALIBAN	3	2	1518	1526	9	72	Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,<br>Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.<br>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br>Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices<br>That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br>Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,<br>The clouds methought would open, and show riches<br>Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked<br>I cried to dream again.

CALIBAN	4	1	1897	1901	5	29	Good my lord, give me thy favor still.<br>Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to<br>Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak<br>softly.<br>All’s hushed as midnight yet.

CALIBAN	5	1	2279	2280	2	19	O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How<br>fine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me.
CALIBAN	5	1	2296	2296	1	6	I shall be pinched to death.
CALIBAN	5	1	2315	2318	4	31	Ay, that I will, and I’ll be wise hereafter<br>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass<br>Was I to take this drunkard for a god,<br>And worship this dull fool!

FRANCISCO-TMP	2	1	804	813	10	76	Sir, he may live.<br>I saw him beat the surges under him<br>And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,<br>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted<br>The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head<br>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared<br>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke<br>To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,<br>As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt<br>He came alive to land.
FRANCISCO-TMP	3	3	1587	1587	1	3	They vanished strangely.
GONZALO	1	1	15	15	1	4	Nay, good, be patient.
GONZALO	1	1	19	20	2	7	Good, yet remember whom thou hast<br>aboard.
GONZALO	1	1	29	34	6	53	I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks<br>he hath no drowning mark upon him. His<br>complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good<br>Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny<br>our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be<br>not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
GONZALO	1	1	47	49	3	21	I’ll warrant him for drowning, though the<br>ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky<br>as an unstanched wench.
GONZALO	1	1	54	55	2	15	The King and Prince at prayers. Let’s assist<br>them, for our case is as theirs.
GONZALO	1	1	60	61	2	19	He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of<br>water swear against it and gape at wid’st to glut him.
GONZALO	1	1	68	71	4	33	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea<br>for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown<br>furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I<br>would fain die a dry death.
GONZALO	2	1	1035	1036	2	6	Now, good angels preserve the<br>King!
GONZALO	2	1	1039	1039	1	3	What’s the matter?
GONZALO	2	1	1049	1054	6	56	Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,<br>And that a strange one too, which did awake me.<br>I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened,<br>I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,<br>That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,<br>Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.
GONZALO	2	1	1057	1058	2	13	Heavens keep him from these beasts,<br>For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.
GONZALO	2	1	685	693	9	72	Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause—<br>So have we all—of joy, for our escape<br>Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe<br>Is common; every day some sailor’s wife,<br>The masters of some merchant, and the merchant<br>Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle—<br>I mean our preservation—few in millions<br>Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh<br>Our sorrow with our comfort.
GONZALO	2	1	700	700	1	1	Sir—
GONZALO	2	1	702	703	2	11	When every grief is entertained that’s offered,<br>comes to th’ entertainer—
GONZALO	2	1	705	706	2	12	Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken<br>truer than you purposed.
GONZALO	2	1	709	709	1	3	Therefore, my lord—
GONZALO	2	1	712	712	1	6	Well, I have done. But yet—
GONZALO	2	1	736	736	1	6	Here is everything advantageous to life.
GONZALO	2	1	739	740	2	9	How lush and lusty the grass looks! How<br>green!
GONZALO	2	1	745	746	2	12	But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost<br>beyond credit—
GONZALO	2	1	748	751	4	25	That our garments, being, as they were,<br>drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their<br>freshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than<br>stained with salt water.
GONZALO	2	1	755	758	4	30	Methinks our garments are now as fresh as<br>when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage<br>of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of<br>Tunis.
GONZALO	2	1	763	763	1	5	Not since widow Dido’s time.
GONZALO	2	1	771	771	1	5	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
GONZALO	2	1	773	773	1	4	I assure you, Carthage.
GONZALO	2	1	782	782	1	1	Ay.
GONZALO	2	1	784	787	4	27	Sir, we were talking that our<br>garments seem now as fresh as when we were at<br>Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now<br>queen.
GONZALO	2	1	791	792	2	19	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as<br>the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.
GONZALO	2	1	794	795	2	8	When I wore it at your daughter’s<br>marriage.
GONZALO	2	1	831	834	4	27	My lord Sebastian,<br>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness<br>And time to speak it in. You rub the sore<br>When you should bring the plaster.
GONZALO	2	1	837	838	2	13	It is foul weather in us all, good sir,<br>When you are cloudy.
GONZALO	2	1	841	841	1	8	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord—
GONZALO	2	1	844	844	1	10	And were the King on ’t, what would I do?
GONZALO	2	1	846	855	10	67	I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries<br>Execute all things, for no kind of traffic<br>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;<br>Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<br>And use of service, none; contract, succession,<br>Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<br>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;<br>No occupation; all men idle, all,<br>And women too, but innocent and pure;<br>No sovereignty—
GONZALO	2	1	859	864	6	44	All things in common nature should produce<br>Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,<br>Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine<br>Would I not have; but nature should bring forth<br>Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,<br>To feed my innocent people.
GONZALO	2	1	867	868	2	12	I would with such perfection govern, sir,<br>T’ excel the Golden Age.
GONZALO	2	1	871	871	1	6	And do you mark me, sir?
GONZALO	2	1	873	876	4	31	I do well believe your Highness, and did it to<br>minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of<br>such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use<br>to laugh at nothing.
GONZALO	2	1	878	880	3	20	Who in this kind of merry fooling am<br>nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at<br>nothing still.
GONZALO	2	1	883	885	3	25	You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You<br>would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would<br>continue in it five weeks without changing.
GONZALO	2	1	888	890	3	22	No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my<br>discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?<br>For I am very heavy.
GONZALO	3	3	1537	1541	5	30	By ’r lakin, I can go no further, sir.<br>My old bones aches. Here’s a maze trod indeed<br>Through forthrights and meanders. By your<br>patience,<br>I needs must rest me.
GONZALO	3	3	1560	1560	1	3	Marvelous sweet music!
GONZALO	3	3	1570	1577	8	55	If in Naples<br>I should report this now, would they believe me?<br>If I should say I saw such islanders—<br>For, certes, these are people of the island—<br>Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note<br>Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of<br>Our human generation you shall find<br>Many, nay, almost any.
GONZALO	3	3	1593	1601	9	57	Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,<br>Who would believe that there were mountaineers<br>Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at<br>’em<br>Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men<br>Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we<br>find<br>Each putter-out of five for one will bring us<br>Good warrant of.
GONZALO	3	3	1650	1651	2	14	I’ th’ name of something holy, sir, why stand you<br>In this strange stare?
GONZALO	3	3	1663	1668	6	48	All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,<br>Like poison given to work a great time after,<br>Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you<br>That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly<br>And hinder them from what this ecstasy<br>May now provoke them to.
GONZALO	5	1	2078	2080	3	18	All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement<br>Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us<br>Out of this fearful country!
GONZALO	5	1	2101	2102	2	9	Whether this be<br>Or be not, I’ll not swear.
GONZALO	5	1	2203	2208	6	36	I have inly wept<br>Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you<br>gods,<br>And on this couple drop a blessèd crown,<br>For it is you that have chalked forth the way<br>Which brought us hither.
GONZALO	5	1	2210	2218	9	68	Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue<br>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice<br>Beyond a common joy, and set it down<br>With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage<br>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,<br>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife<br>Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom<br>In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves<br>When no man was his own.
GONZALO	5	1	2223	2229	7	57	Be it so. Amen.<br>O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.<br>I prophesied if a gallows were on land,<br>This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,<br>That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on<br>shore?<br>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
IRIS	4	1	1736	1752	17	122	Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas<br>Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;<br>Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,<br>And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;<br>Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,<br>Which spongy April at thy hest betrims<br>To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy<br>broom groves,<br>Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves,<br>Being lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard,<br>And thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard,<br>Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o’ th’ sky,<br>Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,<br>Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,<br>Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,<br>To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.<br>Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
IRIS	4	1	1761	1763	3	17	A contract of true love to celebrate,<br>And some donation freely to estate<br>On the blest lovers.
IRIS	4	1	1770	1782	13	81	Of her society<br>Be not afraid. I met her deity<br>Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son<br>Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have<br>done<br>Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,<br>Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid<br>Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.<br>Mars’s hot minion is returned again;<br>Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,<br>Swears he will shoot no more, but play with<br>sparrows,<br>And be a boy right out.
IRIS	4	1	1813	1823	11	80	You nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks,<br>With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,<br>Leave your crisp channels and on this green land<br>Answer your summons, Juno does command.<br>Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate<br>A contract of true love. Be not too late.<br>You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary,<br>Come hither from the furrow and be merry.<br>Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,<br>And these fresh nymphs encounter every one<br>In country footing.
JUNO	4	1	1785	1787	3	22	How does my bounteous sister? Go with me<br>To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be<br>And honored in their issue.
JUNO	4	1	1788	1787	4	19	<span class="song" data-words="19">Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,<br>Long continuance, and increasing,<br>Hourly joys be still upon you.<br>Juno sings her blessings on you.</span>
MARINERS	1	1	52	52	1	8	All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost!
MIRANDA	1	2	113	116	4	23	You have often<br>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped<br>And left me to a bootless inquisition,<br>Concluding <span class="quote" data-words="3">Stay. Not yet.</span>
MIRANDA	1	2	123	123	1	4	Certainly, sir, I can.
MIRANDA	1	2	127	130	4	26	’Tis far off<br>And rather like a dream than an assurance<br>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not<br>Four or five women once that tended me?
MIRANDA	1	2	136	136	1	5	But that I do not.
MIRANDA	1	2	140	140	1	6	Sir, are not you my father?
MIRANDA	1	2	145	147	3	19	O, the heavens!<br>What foul play had we that we came from thence?<br>Or blessèd was ’t we did?
MIRANDA	1	2	151	154	4	23	O, my heart bleeds<br>To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to,<br>Which is from my remembrance. Please you,<br>farther.
MIRANDA	1	2	168	168	1	3	Sir, most heedfully.
MIRANDA	1	2	178	178	1	5	O, good sir, I do.
MIRANDA	1	2	198	198	1	6	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
MIRANDA	1	2	209	209	1	3	O, the heavens!
MIRANDA	1	2	212	214	3	16	I should sin<br>To think but nobly of my grandmother.<br>Good wombs have borne bad sons.
MIRANDA	1	2	228	231	4	26	Alack, for pity!<br>I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,<br>Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint<br>That wrings mine eyes to ’t.
MIRANDA	1	2	236	237	2	8	Wherefore did they not<br>That hour destroy us?
MIRANDA	1	2	251	252	2	8	Alack, what trouble<br>Was I then to you!
MIRANDA	1	2	260	260	1	4	How came we ashore?
MIRANDA	1	2	272	273	2	8	Would I might<br>But ever see that man.
MIRANDA	1	2	280	282	3	25	Heavens thank you for ’t. And now I pray you, sir—<br>For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason<br>For raising this sea storm?
MIRANDA	1	2	436	437	2	9	The strangeness of your story put<br>Heaviness in me.
MIRANDA	1	2	441	442	2	11	’Tis a villain, sir,<br>I do not love to look on.
MIRANDA	1	2	493	507	15	95	Abhorrèd slave,<br>Which any print of goodness wilt not take,<br>Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,<br>Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each<br>hour<br>One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,<br>Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like<br>A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes<br>With words that made them known. But thy vile<br>race,<br>Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good<br>natures<br>Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou<br>Deservedly confined into this rock,<br>Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
MIRANDA	1	2	559	561	3	22	What is ’t? A spirit?<br>Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,<br>It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.
MIRANDA	1	2	569	571	3	15	I might call him<br>A thing divine, for nothing natural<br>I ever saw so noble.
MIRANDA	1	2	583	584	2	7	No wonder, sir,<br>But certainly a maid.
MIRANDA	1	2	595	595	1	3	Alack, for mercy!
MIRANDA	1	2	605	608	4	31	Why speaks my father so ungently? This<br>Is the third man that e’er I saw, the first<br>That e’er I sighed for. Pity move my father<br>To be inclined my way.
MIRANDA	1	2	623	625	3	26	There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.<br>If the ill spirit have so fair a house,<br>Good things will strive to dwell with ’t.
MIRANDA	1	2	636	638	3	17	O dear father,<br>Make not too rash a trial of him, for<br>He’s gentle and not fearful.
MIRANDA	1	2	646	646	1	3	Beseech you, father—
MIRANDA	1	2	648	649	2	7	Sir, have pity.<br>I’ll be his surety.
MIRANDA	1	2	657	659	3	15	My affections<br>Are then most humble. I have no ambition<br>To see a goodlier man.
MIRANDA	1	2	675	679	5	23	Be of<br>comfort.<br>My father’s of a better nature, sir,<br>Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted<br>Which now came from him.
MIRANDA	1	2	72	84	13	111	If by your art, my dearest father, you have<br>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<br>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,<br>But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,<br>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered<br>With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,<br>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,<br>Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock<br>Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.<br>Had I been any god of power, I would<br>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere<br>It should the good ship so have swallowed, and<br>The fraughting souls within her.
MIRANDA	1	2	88	88	1	4	O, woe the day!
MIRANDA	1	2	96	97	2	9	More to know<br>Did never meddle with my thoughts.
MIRANDA	3	1	1272	1278	7	55	Alas now, pray you,<br>Work not so hard. I would the lightning had<br>Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile.<br>Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns<br>’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father<br>Is hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.<br>He’s safe for these three hours.
MIRANDA	3	1	1282	1284	3	20	If you’ll sit down,<br>I’ll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that.<br>I’ll carry it to the pile.
MIRANDA	3	1	1289	1292	4	31	It would become me<br>As well as it does you, and I should do it<br>With much more ease, for my good will is to it,<br>And yours it is against.
MIRANDA	3	1	1295	1295	1	3	You look wearily.
MIRANDA	3	1	1300	1301	2	12	Miranda.—O my father,<br>I have broke your hest to say so!
MIRANDA	3	1	1314	1325	12	89	I do not know<br>One of my sex, no woman’s face remember,<br>Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen<br>More that I may call men than you, good friend,<br>And my dear father. How features are abroad<br>I am skilless of, but by my modesty,<br>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish<br>Any companion in the world but you,<br>Nor can imagination form a shape<br>Besides yourself to like of. But I prattle<br>Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts<br>I therein do forget.
MIRANDA	3	1	1335	1335	1	4	Do you love me?
MIRANDA	3	1	1342	1343	2	12	I am a fool<br>To weep at what I am glad of.
MIRANDA	3	1	1349	1358	10	83	At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer<br>What I desire to give, and much less take<br>What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,<br>And all the more it seeks to hide itself,<br>The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,<br>And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.<br>I am your wife if you will marry me.<br>If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow<br>You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant<br>Whether you will or no.
MIRANDA	3	1	1360	1360	1	3	My husband, then?
MIRANDA	3	1	1363	1364	2	15	And mine, with my heart in ’t. And now farewell<br>Till half an hour hence.
MIRANDA	4	1	1830	1831	2	12	Never till this day<br>Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered.
MIRANDA	4	1	1850	1850	1	4	We wish your peace.
MIRANDA	5	1	2164	2164	1	6	Sweet lord, you play me false.
MIRANDA	5	1	2167	2168	2	16	Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,<br>And I would call it fair play.
MIRANDA	5	1	2179	2182	4	23	O wonder!<br>How many goodly creatures are there here!<br>How beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world<br>That has such people in ’t!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	1	1	41	42	2	10	A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,<br>incharitable dog!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	1	1	56	56	1	5	I am out of patience.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	1	1	67	67	1	5	Let’s take leave of him.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	1000	1000	1	4	But, for your conscience?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	1016	1020	5	37	Thy case, dear friend,<br>Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,<br>I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke<br>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,<br>And I the King shall love thee.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	1024	1024	1	4	O, but one word.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	1040	1043	4	32	Whiles we stood here securing your repose,<br>Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing<br>Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you?<br>It struck mine ear most terribly.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	695	696	2	6	He receives comfort like<br>cold porridge.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	698	699	2	15	Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit.<br>By and by it will strike.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	701	701	1	2	One. Tell.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	704	704	1	2	A dollar.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	707	708	2	10	You have taken it wiselier than I meant you<br>should.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	713	713	1	4	He will be talking.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	716	716	1	3	The old cock.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	718	718	1	3	Done. The wager?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	720	720	1	2	A match!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	723	723	1	3	So. You’re paid.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	725	725	1	1	Yet—
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	731	732	2	9	Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly<br>delivered.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	734	734	1	8	As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	738	738	1	6	Of that there’s none, or little.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	742	742	1	7	With an eye of green in ’t.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	744	744	1	8	No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	747	747	1	5	As many vouched rarities are.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	754	754	1	8	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	759	760	2	11	’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper<br>well in our return.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	766	767	2	14	What if he had said <span class="quote" data-words="2">widower Aeneas</span> too?<br>Good Lord, how you take it!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	775	775	1	8	He hath raised the wall, and houses too.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	778	779	2	19	I think he will carry this island home in his<br>pocket and give it his son for an apple.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	789	789	1	6	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	815	819	5	43	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,<br>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,<br>But rather lose her to an African,<br>Where she at least is banished from your eye,<br>Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	821	829	9	60	You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise<br>By all of us; and the fair soul herself<br>Weighed between loathness and obedience at<br>Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost<br>your son,<br>I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have<br>More widows in them of this business’ making<br>Than we bring men to comfort them.<br>The fault’s your own.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	835	835	1	2	Very well.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	839	839	1	2	Foul weather?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	843	843	1	4	Or docks, or mallows.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	845	845	1	7	Scape being drunk, for want of wine.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	856	856	1	7	Yet he would be king on ’t.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	865	865	1	5	No marrying ’mong his subjects?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	869	869	1	3	’Save his Majesty!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	882	882	1	6	An it had not fallen flatlong.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	886	886	1	7	We would so, and then go a-batfowling.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	895	898	4	22	Please you, sir,<br>Do not omit the heavy offer of it.<br>It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,<br>It is a comforter.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	903	903	1	6	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	905	907	3	15	Why<br>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find<br>Not myself disposed to sleep.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	916	916	1	4	What, art thou waking?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	918	923	6	42	I do, and surely<br>It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st<br>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?<br>This is a strange repose, to be asleep<br>With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving—<br>And yet so fast asleep.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	927	928	2	9	Thou dost snore distinctly.<br>There’s meaning in thy snores.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	932	932	1	5	Well, I am standing water.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	934	935	2	8	Do so. To ebb<br>Hereditary sloth instructs me.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	942	945	4	25	Prithee, say on.<br>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim<br>A matter from thee, and a birth indeed<br>Which throes thee much to yield.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	954	955	2	7	I have no hope<br>That he’s undrowned.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	962	962	1	2	He’s gone.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	965	965	1	1	Claribel.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	975	978	4	28	What stuff is this? How say you?<br>’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,<br>So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions<br>There is some space.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	991	991	1	3	Methinks I do.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	2	1	994	995	2	8	I remember<br>You did supplant your brother Prospero.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	3	3	1552	1553	2	7	The next advantage<br>Will we take throughly.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	3	3	1558	1558	1	5	I say tonight. No more.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	3	3	1562	1565	4	28	A living drollery! Now I will believe<br>That there are unicorns, that in Arabia<br>There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix<br>At this hour reigning there.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	3	3	1588	1591	4	22	No matter, since<br>They have left their viands behind, for we have<br>stomachs.<br>Will ’t please you taste of what is here?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	3	3	1660	1661	2	11	But one fiend at a time,<br>I’ll fight their legions o’er.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2111	2111	1	5	The devil speaks in him.
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2172	2172	1	4	A most high miracle!
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2281	2283	3	13	Ha, ha!<br>What things are these, my Lord Antonio?<br>Will money buy ’em?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2298	2298	1	8	He is drunk now. Where had he wine?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2305	2305	1	4	Why, how now, Stephano?
SEBASTIAN-TMP	5	1	2321	2321	1	4	Or stole it, rather.
SHIPMASTER	1	1	1	1	1	1	Boatswain!
SHIPMASTER	1	1	3	4	2	16	Good, speak to th’ mariners. Fall to ’t yarely,<br>or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir!
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1104	1106	14	112	<span class="song" data-words="13">I shall no more to sea, to sea.<br>Here shall I die ashore—</span>This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.<br>Well, here’s my comfort.<span class="song" data-words="71">The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,<br>The gunner and his mate,<br>Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,<br>But none of us cared for Kate.<br>For she had a tongue with a tang,<br>Would cry to a sailor <span class="quote" data-words="2">Go hang!</span><br>She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,<br>Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.<br>Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</span><br>This is a scurvy tune too.

STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1119	1123	7	65	What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do<br>you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind?<br>Ha?

STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1127	1133	7	66	This is some monster of the isle with four<br>legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the<br>devil should he learn our language? I will give him<br>some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him<br>and keep him tame and get to Naples with him,<br>he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on<br>neat’s leather.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1136	1141	6	61	He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after<br>the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have<br>never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove<br>his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will<br>not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that<br>hath him, and that soundly.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1145	1150	6	44	Come on your ways. Open your mouth.<br>Here is that which will give language to you, cat.<br>Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I<br>can tell you, and that soundly. You<br>cannot tell who’s your friend. Open your chaps<br>again.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1153	1159	7	58	Four legs and two voices—a most delicate<br>monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of<br>his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul<br>speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle<br>will recover him, I will help his ague. Come.<br>Amen! I will pour some in thy<br>other mouth.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1161	1163	3	24	Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,<br>this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I<br>have no long spoon.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1167	1172	6	48	If thou be’st Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull<br>thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo’s legs,<br>these are they.<br>Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How<br>cam’st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can<br>he vent Trinculos?
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1179	1180	2	11	Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach<br>is not constant.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1184	1189	6	49	How didst thou scape? How<br>cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou<br>cam’st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which<br>the sailors heaved o’erboard—by this bottle, which<br>I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands,<br>since I was cast ashore.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1192	1193	2	6	Here. Swear then how thou<br>escapedst.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1196	1198	3	19	Here, kiss the book.<br>Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made<br>like a goose.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1200	1202	3	25	The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock<br>by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid.—How now,<br>mooncalf, how does thine ague?
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1204	1205	2	18	Out o’ th’ moon, I do assure thee. I was the<br>man i’ th’ moon when time was.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1209	1210	2	18	Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will<br>furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1220	1220	1	6	Come on, then. Down, and swear.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1224	1224	1	2	Come, kiss.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1240	1244	5	37	I prithee now, lead the way without any<br>more talking.—Trinculo, the King and all our<br>company else being drowned, we will inherit here.<br>—Here, bear my bottle.—Fellow Trinculo, we’ll<br>fill him by and by again.
STEPHANO-TMP	2	2	1255	1255	1	6	O brave monster! Lead the way.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1371	1374	4	27	Tell not me. When the butt is<br>out, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore<br>bear up and board ’em.—Servant monster,<br>drink to me.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1379	1380	2	15	Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.<br>Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1383	1387	5	41	My man-monster hath drowned his tongue<br>in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I<br>swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty<br>leagues off and on, by this light.—Thou shalt be my<br>lieutenant, monster, or my standard.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1390	1390	1	5	We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1393	1394	2	12	Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou<br>be’st a good mooncalf.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1408	1411	4	27	Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.<br>If you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor<br>monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer<br>indignity.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1414	1415	2	14	Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will<br>stand, and so shall Trinculo.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1423	1425	3	20	Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s<br>tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your<br>teeth.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1427	1428	2	9	Mum then, and no more.<br>Proceed.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1433	1433	1	3	That’s most certain.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1435	1436	2	13	How now shall this be compassed? Canst<br>thou bring me to the party?
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1445	1448	4	29	Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt<br>the monster one word further, and by this<br>hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a<br>stockfish of thee.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1451	1451	1	6	Didst thou not say he lied?
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1453	1454	2	19	Do I so? Take thou that.<br>As you like this, give me the lie another time.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1460	1461	2	11	Now forward with your tale.<br>Prithee, stand further off.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1464	1465	2	8	Stand farther.<br>Come, proceed.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1483	1483	1	6	Is it so brave a lass?
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1486	1489	4	31	Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter<br>and I will be king and queen—save our Graces!—<br>and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.—Dost<br>thou like the plot, Trinculo?
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1491	1493	3	21	Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee.<br>But while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy<br>head.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1496	1496	1	4	Ay, on mine honor.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1501	1502	5	31	At thy request, monster, I will do reason,<br>any reason.—Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.<span class="song" data-words="14">Flout ’em and cout ’em<br>And scout ’em and flout ’em!<br>Thought is free.</span>
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1507	1507	1	4	What is this same?
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1510	1512	3	20	If thou be’st a<br>man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be’st a<br>devil, take ’t as thou list.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1514	1515	2	12	He that dies pays all debts.—I defy thee!—<br>Mercy upon us.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1517	1517	1	4	No, monster, not I.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1527	1528	2	16	This will prove a brave kingdom to me,<br>where I shall have my music for nothing.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1530	1531	2	10	That shall be by and by. I remember the<br>story.
STEPHANO-TMP	3	2	1534	1535	2	17	Lead, monster. We’ll follow.—I would I<br>could see this taborer. He lays it on. Wilt come?
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1889	1891	3	20	Monster, your fairy, which you say is a<br>harmless fairy, has done little better than played the<br>jack with us.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1894	1895	2	17	So is mine.—Do you hear, monster. If I<br>should take a displeasure against you, look you—
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1903	1904	2	14	There is not only disgrace and dishonor in<br>that, monster, but an infinite loss.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1907	1908	2	14	I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er<br>ears for my labor.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1914	1915	2	11	Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody<br>thoughts.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1923	1924	2	12	Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,<br>I’ll have that gown.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1931	1934	4	39	Be you quiet, monster.—Mistress Line, is<br>not this my jerkin?<br>Now is the jerkin under the line.—Now, jerkin, you<br>are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1937	1940	4	39	I thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment<br>for ’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king<br>of this country. <span class="quote" data-words="5">Steal by line and level</span> is an excellent<br>pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1946	1948	3	28	Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear<br>this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn<br>you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.
STEPHANO-TMP	4	1	1950	1950	1	3	Ay, and this.
STEPHANO-TMP	5	1	2274	2276	3	24	Every man shift for all the rest, and let no<br>man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.<br>Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio.
STEPHANO-TMP	5	1	2306	2307	2	11	O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a<br>cramp.
STEPHANO-TMP	5	1	2309	2309	1	8	I should have been a sore one, then.
TRINCULO	2	2	1079	1103	25	247	Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off<br>any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I<br>hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond<br>huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed<br>his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I<br>know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud<br>cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.<br>What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or<br>alive? A fish, he smells like a fish—a very ancient<br>and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John.<br>A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once<br>I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday<br>fool there but would give a piece of silver. There<br>would this monster make a man. Any strange beast<br>there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to<br>relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a<br>dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like<br>arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my<br>opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an<br>islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.<br>Alas, the storm is come again. My best<br>way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no<br>other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man<br>with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the<br>dregs of the storm be past.
TRINCULO	2	2	1151	1152	2	19	I should know that voice. It should be—but<br>he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!
TRINCULO	2	2	1160	1160	1	1	Stephano!
TRINCULO	2	2	1164	1166	3	22	Stephano! If thou be’st Stephano, touch me<br>and speak to me, for I am Trinculo—be not<br>afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.
TRINCULO	2	2	1173	1178	6	49	I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.<br>But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I<br>hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm<br>overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s<br>gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living,<br>Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!
TRINCULO	2	2	1194	1195	2	15	Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim<br>like a duck, I’ll be sworn.
TRINCULO	2	2	1199	1199	1	7	O Stephano, hast any more of this?
TRINCULO	2	2	1211	1214	4	34	By this good light, this is a very shallow<br>monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The<br>man i’ th’ moon? A most poor, credulous monster!<br>—Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!
TRINCULO	2	2	1217	1218	2	17	By this light, a most perfidious and drunken<br>monster. When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.
TRINCULO	2	2	1221	1223	3	23	I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed<br>monster. A most scurvy monster. I could<br>find in my heart to beat him—
TRINCULO	2	2	1225	1226	2	10	But that the poor monster’s in drink. An<br>abominable monster.
TRINCULO	2	2	1232	1233	2	12	A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder<br>of a poor drunkard.
TRINCULO	2	2	1246	1246	1	6	A howling monster, a drunken monster.
TRINCULO	3	2	1375	1378	4	31	Servant monster? The folly of this island!<br>They say there’s but five upon this isle; we are three<br>of them. If th’ other two be brained like us, the state<br>totters.
TRINCULO	3	2	1381	1382	2	19	Where should they be set else? He were a<br>brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.
TRINCULO	3	2	1388	1389	2	8	Your lieutenant, if you list. He’s no<br>standard.
TRINCULO	3	2	1391	1392	2	13	Nor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and<br>yet say nothing neither.
TRINCULO	3	2	1397	1402	6	48	Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in<br>case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched<br>fish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath<br>drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a<br>monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a<br>monster?
TRINCULO	3	2	1405	1406	2	11	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Lord,</span> quoth he? That a monster should be<br>such a natural!
TRINCULO	3	2	1426	1426	1	4	Why, I said nothing.
TRINCULO	3	2	1449	1450	2	11	Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go<br>farther off.
TRINCULO	3	2	1455	1458	4	35	I did not give the lie! Out o’ your wits and<br>hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! This can sack and<br>drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the<br>devil take your fingers!
TRINCULO	3	2	1490	1490	1	1	Excellent.
TRINCULO	3	2	1508	1509	2	13	This is the tune of our catch played by the<br>picture of Nobody.
TRINCULO	3	2	1513	1513	1	5	O, forgive me my sins!
TRINCULO	3	2	1532	1533	2	13	The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and<br>after do our work.
TRINCULO	3	2	1536	1536	1	3	I’ll follow, Stephano.
TRINCULO	4	1	1892	1893	2	15	Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which<br>my nose is in great indignation.
TRINCULO	4	1	1896	1896	1	6	Thou wert but a lost monster.
TRINCULO	4	1	1902	1902	1	9	Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
TRINCULO	4	1	1905	1906	2	14	That’s more to me than my wetting. Yet this<br>is your harmless fairy, monster!
TRINCULO	4	1	1916	1918	3	16	O King Stephano, O<br>peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe<br>here is for thee!
TRINCULO	4	1	1920	1922	3	19	Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a<br>frippery. O King<br>Stephano!
TRINCULO	4	1	1925	1925	1	5	Thy Grace shall have it.
TRINCULO	4	1	1935	1936	2	13	Do, do. We steal by line and level, an ’t like<br>your Grace.
TRINCULO	4	1	1941	1942	2	13	Monster, come, put some lime upon your<br>fingers, and away with the rest.
TRINCULO	4	1	1949	1949	1	2	And this.
TRINCULO	5	1	2277	2278	2	15	If these be true spies which I wear in my<br>head, here’s a goodly sight.
TRINCULO	5	1	2302	2304	3	27	I have been in such a pickle since I saw you<br>last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I<br>shall not fear flyblowing.
