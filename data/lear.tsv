ALBANY	1	1	186	186	1	3	Dear sir, forbear.
ALBANY	1	4	849	849	1	4	Pray, sir, be patient.
ALBANY	1	4	862	863	2	14	My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant<br>Of what hath moved you.
ALBANY	1	4	880	880	1	8	Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
ALBANY	1	4	886	886	1	4	What’s the matter, sir?
ALBANY	1	4	905	906	2	13	I cannot be so partial, Goneril,<br>To the great love I bear you—
ALBANY	1	4	924	924	1	6	Well, you may fear too far.
ALBANY	1	4	944	945	2	17	How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.<br>Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.
ALBANY	1	4	947	947	1	4	Well, well, th’ event.
ALBANY	4	2	2509	2516	8	51	O Goneril,<br>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>Blows in your face. I fear your disposition.<br>That nature which contemns its origin<br>Cannot be bordered certain in itself.<br>She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br>From her material sap perforce must wither<br>And come to deadly use.
ALBANY	4	2	2518	2532	15	93	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.<br>Filths savor but themselves. What have you done?<br>Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?<br>A father, and a gracious agèd man,<br>Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would<br>lick,<br>Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you<br>madded.<br>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br>Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses,<br>It will come:<br>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br>Like monsters of the deep.
ALBANY	4	2	2544	2546	3	15	See thyself, devil!<br>Proper deformity shows not in the fiend<br>So horrid as in woman.
ALBANY	4	2	2548	2553	6	45	Thou changèd and self-covered thing, for shame<br>Bemonster not thy feature. Were ’t my fitness<br>To let these hands obey my blood,<br>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br>Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,<br>A woman’s shape doth shield thee.
ALBANY	4	2	2555	2555	1	2	What news?
ALBANY	4	2	2559	2559	1	2	Gloucester’s eyes?
ALBANY	4	2	2566	2569	4	25	This shows you are above,<br>You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br>So speedily can venge. But, O poor Gloucester,<br>Lost he his other eye?
ALBANY	4	2	2578	2578	1	10	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
ALBANY	4	2	2580	2580	1	4	He is not here.
ALBANY	4	2	2582	2582	1	4	Knows he the wickedness?
ALBANY	4	2	2586	2589	4	27	Gloucester, I live<br>To thank thee for the love thou show’d’st the King,<br>And to revenge thine eyes.—Come hither, friend.<br>Tell me what more thou know’st.
ALBANY	5	1	3183	3190	8	67	Our very loving sister, well bemet.—<br>Sir, this I heard: the King is come to his daughter,<br>With others whom the rigor of our state<br>Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,<br>I never yet was valiant. For this business,<br>It touches us as France invades our land,<br>Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,<br>Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
ALBANY	5	1	3196	3197	2	11	Let’s then determine<br>With th’ ancient of war on our proceeding.
ALBANY	5	1	3205	3205	1	4	I’ll overtake you.—Speak.
ALBANY	5	1	3213	3213	1	7	Stay till I have read the letter.
ALBANY	5	1	3217	3217	1	9	Why, fare thee well. I will o’erlook thy paper.
ALBANY	5	1	3222	3222	1	5	We will greet the time.
ALBANY	5	3	3296	3301	6	47	Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain,<br>And Fortune led you well. You have the captives<br>Who were the opposites of this day’s strife.<br>I do require them of you, so to use them<br>As we shall find their merits and our safety<br>May equally determine.
ALBANY	5	3	3318	3320	3	17	Sir, by your patience,<br>I hold you but a subject of this war,<br>Not as a brother.
ALBANY	5	3	3344	3344	1	7	The let-alone lies not in your goodwill.
ALBANY	5	3	3346	3346	1	3	Half-blooded fellow, yes.
ALBANY	5	3	3348	3356	9	59	Stay yet, hear reason.—Edmund, I arrest thee<br>On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,<br>This gilded serpent.—For your claim, fair<br>sister,<br>I bar it in the interest of my wife.<br>’Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,<br>And I, her husband, contradict your banns.<br>If you will marry, make your loves to me.<br>My lady is bespoke.
ALBANY	5	3	3358	3364	7	52	Thou art armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.<br>If none appear to prove upon thy person<br>Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,<br>There is my pledge.<br>I’ll make it on thy heart,<br>Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less<br>Than I have here proclaimed thee.
ALBANY	5	3	3373	3373	1	3	A herald, ho!
ALBANY	5	3	3375	3377	3	20	Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers,<br>All levied in my name, have in my name<br>Took their discharge.
ALBANY	5	3	3379	3381	3	28	She is not well. Convey her to my tent.<br>Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,<br>And read out this.
ALBANY	5	3	3390	3391	2	13	Ask him his purposes, why he appears<br>Upon this call o’ th’ trumpet.
ALBANY	5	3	3399	3399	1	4	Which is that adversary?
ALBANY	5	3	3430	3430	1	4	Save him, save him!
ALBANY	5	3	3435	3438	4	31	Shut your mouth, dame,<br>Or with this paper shall I stopple it.—Hold, sir.—<br>Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.<br>No tearing, lady. I perceive you know it.
ALBANY	5	3	3441	3442	2	7	Most monstrous! O!<br>Know’st thou this paper?
ALBANY	5	3	3444	3444	1	7	Go after her, she’s desperate. Govern her.
ALBANY	5	3	3460	3463	4	27	Methought thy very gait did prophesy<br>A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.<br>Let sorrow split my heart if ever I<br>Did hate thee or thy father!
ALBANY	5	3	3465	3466	2	14	Where have you hid yourself?<br>How have you known the miseries of your father?
ALBANY	5	3	3489	3491	3	19	If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,<br>For I am almost ready to dissolve,<br>Hearing of this.
ALBANY	5	3	3507	3507	1	4	But who was this?
ALBANY	5	3	3513	3513	1	2	Speak, man!
ALBANY	5	3	3517	3517	1	4	Who dead? Speak, man.
ALBANY	5	3	3523	3528	6	41	Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.<br>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us<br>tremble,<br>Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?<br>The time will not allow the compliment<br>Which very manners urges.
ALBANY	5	3	3532	3535	4	24	Great thing of us forgot!<br>Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? And where’s<br>Cordelia?<br>Seest thou this object, Kent?
ALBANY	5	3	3540	3540	1	5	Even so.—Cover their faces.
ALBANY	5	3	3546	3546	1	4	Run, run, O, run!
ALBANY	5	3	3557	3557	1	8	The gods defend her!—Bear him hence awhile.
ALBANY	5	3	3568	3568	1	3	Fall and cease.
ALBANY	5	3	3605	3606	2	16	He knows not what he says, and vain is it<br>That we present us to him.
ALBANY	5	3	3609	3618	10	77	That’s but a trifle here.—<br>You lords and noble friends, know our intent:<br>What comfort to this great decay may come<br>Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,<br>During the life of this old Majesty,<br>To him our absolute power; you to your rights,<br>With boot and such addition as your Honors<br>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste<br>The wages of their virtue, and all foes<br>The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
ALBANY	5	3	3636	3639	4	29	Bear them from hence. Our present business<br>Is general woe. Friends of my<br>soul, you twain<br>Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
BURGUNDY-LR	1	1	220	222	3	17	Most royal Majesty,<br>I crave no more than hath your Highness offered,<br>Nor will you tender less.
BURGUNDY-LR	1	1	230	230	1	4	I know no answer.
BURGUNDY-LR	1	1	236	237	2	11	Pardon me, royal sir,<br>Election makes not up in such conditions.
BURGUNDY-LR	1	1	279	282	4	20	Royal king,<br>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,<br>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br>Duchess of Burgundy.
BURGUNDY-LR	1	1	284	285	2	16	I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father<br>That you must lose a husband.
CAPTAIN1	5	3	3290	3290	1	5	I’ll do ’t, my lord.
CAPTAIN1	5	3	3294	3295	2	17	I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.<br>If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t.
CAPTAIN2	5	3	3382	3382	1	2	Sound, trumpet!
CORDELIA	1	1	100	102	3	24	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br>My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty<br>According to my bond, no more nor less.
CORDELIA	1	1	105	115	11	78	Good my lord,<br>You have begot me, bred me, loved me.<br>I return those duties back as are right fit:<br>Obey you, love you, and most honor you.<br>Why have my sisters husbands if they say<br>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall<br>carry<br>Half my love with him, half my care and duty.<br>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br>To love my father all.
CORDELIA	1	1	117	117	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
CORDELIA	1	1	119	119	1	6	So young, my lord, and true.
CORDELIA	1	1	257	268	12	93	I yet beseech your Majesty—<br>If for I want that glib and oily art<br>To speak and purpose not, since what I well<br>intend<br>I’ll do ’t before I speak—that you make known<br>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br>No unchaste action or dishonored step<br>That hath deprived me of your grace and favor,<br>But even for want of that for which I am richer:<br>A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue<br>That I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br>Hath lost me in your liking.
CORDELIA	1	1	286	289	4	18	Peace be with<br>Burgundy.<br>Since that respect and fortunes are his love,<br>I shall not be his wife.
CORDELIA	1	1	311	319	9	64	The jewels of our father, with washed eyes<br>Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,<br>And like a sister am most loath to call<br>Your faults as they are named. Love well our<br>father.<br>To your professèd bosoms I commit him;<br>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br>I would prefer him to a better place.<br>So farewell to you both.
CORDELIA	1	1	325	327	3	19	Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,<br>Who covers faults at last with shame derides.<br>Well may you prosper.
CORDELIA	1	1	68	68	1	8	What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
CORDELIA	1	1	85	87	3	18	Then poor Cordelia!<br>And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s<br>More ponderous than my tongue.
CORDELIA	1	1	96	96	1	3	Nothing, my lord.
CORDELIA	1	1	98	98	1	1	Nothing.
CORDELIA	4	4	2656	2666	11	78	Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now<br>As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,<br>Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,<br>With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckooflowers,<br>Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow<br>In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.<br>Search every acre in the high-grown field<br>And bring him to our eye.<br>What can man’s wisdom<br>In the restoring his bereavèd sense?<br>He that helps him take all my outward worth.
CORDELIA	4	4	2672	2677	6	41	All blest secrets,<br>All you unpublished virtues of the earth,<br>Spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediate<br>In the good man’s distress. Seek, seek for him,<br>Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life<br>That wants the means to lead it.
CORDELIA	4	4	2680	2687	8	54	’Tis known before. Our preparation stands<br>In expectation of them.—O dear father,<br>It is thy business that I go about.<br>Therefore great France<br>My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.<br>No blown ambition doth our arms incite,<br>But love, dear love, and our aged father’s right.<br>Soon may I hear and see him.
CORDELIA	4	7	3049	3051	3	25	O, thou good Kent, how shall I live and work<br>To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,<br>And every measure fail me.
CORDELIA	4	7	3055	3057	3	16	Be better suited.<br>These weeds are memories of those worser hours.<br>I prithee put them off.
CORDELIA	4	7	3062	3062	1	11	Then be ’t so, my good lord.—How does the King?
CORDELIA	4	7	3064	3067	4	24	O, you kind gods,<br>Cure this great breach in his abusèd nature!<br>Th’ untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up,<br>Of this child-changèd father!
CORDELIA	4	7	3071	3072	2	17	Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed<br>I’ th’ sway of your own will. Is he arrayed?
CORDELIA	4	7	3077	3077	1	2	Very well.
CORDELIA	4	7	3079	3082	4	28	O, my dear father, restoration hang<br>Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss<br>Repair those violent harms that my two sisters<br>Have in thy reverence made.
CORDELIA	4	7	3084	3096	13	105	Had you not been their father, these white flakes<br>Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face<br>To be opposed against the jarring winds?<br>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder,<br>In the most terrible and nimble stroke<br>Of quick cross-lightning? To watch, poor <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="fr">perdu</span>,<br>With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog,<br>Though he had bit me, should have stood that night<br>Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,<br>To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn<br>In short and musty straw? Alack, alack,<br>’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once<br>Had not concluded all.—He wakes. Speak to him.
CORDELIA	4	7	3098	3098	1	9	How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
CORDELIA	4	7	3103	3103	1	5	Sir, do you know me?
CORDELIA	4	7	3105	3105	1	4	Still, still, far wide.
CORDELIA	4	7	3113	3115	3	19	O, look upon me, sir,<br>And hold your hand in benediction o’er me.<br>No, sir, you must not kneel.
CORDELIA	4	7	3128	3128	1	6	And so I am; I am.
CORDELIA	4	7	3134	3135	2	4	No cause, no<br>cause.
CORDELIA	4	7	3144	3144	1	6	Will ’t please your Highness walk?
CORDELIA	5	3	3254	3258	5	37	We are not the first<br>Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.<br>For thee, oppressèd king, I am cast down.<br>Myself could else outfrown false Fortune’s frown.<br>Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
CORNWALL	1	1	186	186	1	3	Dear sir, forbear.
CORNWALL	2	1	1099	1101	3	20	How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,<br>Which I can call but now, I have heard strange<br>news.
CORNWALL	2	1	1120	1122	3	17	Nor I, assure thee, Regan.—<br>Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father<br>A childlike office.
CORNWALL	2	1	1126	1126	1	3	Is he pursued?
CORNWALL	2	1	1128	1134	7	55	If he be taken, he shall never more<br>Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,<br>How in my strength you please.—For you, Edmund,<br>Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant<br>So much commend itself, you shall be ours.<br>Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.<br>You we first seize on.
CORNWALL	2	1	1138	1138	1	9	You know not why we came to visit you—
CORNWALL	2	2	1199	1200	2	14	Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that<br>strikes again. What is the matter?
CORNWALL	2	2	1202	1202	1	5	What is your difference? Speak.
CORNWALL	2	2	1207	1208	2	10	Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a<br>man?
CORNWALL	2	2	1212	1212	1	6	Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
CORNWALL	2	2	1220	1221	2	9	Peace, sirrah!<br>You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
CORNWALL	2	2	1223	1223	1	4	Why art thou angry?
CORNWALL	2	2	1239	1239	1	6	What, art thou mad, old fellow?
CORNWALL	2	2	1243	1243	1	10	Why dost thou call him <span class="quote" data-words="1">knave</span>? What is his fault?
CORNWALL	2	2	1245	1245	1	9	No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
CORNWALL	2	2	1250	1260	11	72	This is some fellow<br>Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect<br>A saucy roughness and constrains the garb<br>Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he.<br>An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!<br>An they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.<br>These kind of knaves I know, which in this<br>plainness<br>Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends<br>Than twenty silly-ducking observants<br>That stretch their duties nicely.
CORNWALL	2	2	1265	1265	1	4	What mean’st by this?
CORNWALL	2	2	1271	1272	2	7	What was th’ offense you gave<br>him?
CORNWALL	2	2	1285	1287	3	14	Fetch forth the stocks.—<br>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,<br>We’ll teach you.
CORNWALL	2	2	1295	1296	2	16	Fetch forth the stocks.—As I have life and honor,<br>There shall he sit till noon.
CORNWALL	2	2	1301	1302	2	17	This is a fellow of the selfsame color<br>Our sister speaks of.—Come, bring away the stocks.
CORNWALL	2	2	1311	1311	1	3	I’ll answer that.
CORNWALL	2	2	1315	1315	1	5	Come, my good lord, away.
CORNWALL	2	4	1502	1502	1	4	Hail to your Grace.
CORNWALL	2	4	1545	1545	1	3	Fie, sir, fie!
CORNWALL	2	4	1567	1567	1	3	What trumpet’s that?
CORNWALL	2	4	1574	1574	1	4	What means your Grace?
CORNWALL	2	4	1590	1591	2	13	I set him there, sir, but his own disorders<br>Deserved much less advancement.
CORNWALL	2	4	1688	1688	1	7	Let us withdraw. ’Twill be a storm.
CORNWALL	2	4	1696	1697	2	10	Followed the old man forth.<br>He is returned.
CORNWALL	2	4	1699	1699	1	4	Whither is he going?
CORNWALL	2	4	1701	1701	1	9	’Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.
CORNWALL	2	4	1712	1713	2	19	Shut up your doors, my lord. ’Tis a wild night.<br>My Regan counsels well. Come out o’ th’ storm.
CORNWALL	3	5	2101	2102	2	10	I will have my revenge ere I depart his<br>house.
CORNWALL	3	5	2106	2109	4	28	I now perceive it was not altogether your<br>brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death,<br>but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable<br>badness in himself.
CORNWALL	3	5	2115	2115	1	6	Go with me to the Duchess.
CORNWALL	3	5	2118	2120	3	24	True or false, it hath made thee Earl of<br>Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he<br>may be ready for our apprehension.
CORNWALL	3	5	2125	2126	2	16	I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt<br>find a dearer father in my love.
CORNWALL	3	7	2253	2256	4	27	Post speedily to my lord your<br>husband. Show him this letter.<br>The army of France is landed.—Seek out<br>the traitor Gloucester.
CORNWALL	3	7	2259	2267	9	72	Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund,<br>keep you our sister company. The revenges we are<br>bound to take upon your traitorous father are not<br>fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke, where you<br>are going, to a most festinate preparation; we are<br>bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and<br>intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.—<br>Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.<br>How now? Where’s the King?
CORNWALL	3	7	2274	2274	1	5	Get horses for your mistress.
CORNWALL	3	7	2276	2284	9	62	Edmund, farewell.<br>Go seek the traitor Gloucester.<br>Pinion him like a thief; bring him before us.<br>Though well we may not pass upon his life<br>Without the form of justice, yet our power<br>Shall do a court’sy to our wrath, which men<br>May blame but not control.<br>Who’s there? The<br>traitor?
CORNWALL	3	7	2286	2286	1	5	Bind fast his corky arms.
CORNWALL	3	7	2290	2290	1	4	Bind him, I say.
CORNWALL	3	7	2293	2294	2	12	To this chair bind him.<br>Villain, thou shalt find—
CORNWALL	3	7	2303	2303	1	9	Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
CORNWALL	3	7	2305	2306	2	13	And what confederacy have you with the traitors<br>Late footed in the kingdom?
CORNWALL	3	7	2312	2312	1	1	Cunning.
CORNWALL	3	7	2314	2314	1	6	Where hast thou sent the King?
CORNWALL	3	7	2318	2318	1	7	Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.
CORNWALL	3	7	2333	2334	2	18	See ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.—<br>Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.
CORNWALL	3	7	2339	2339	1	4	If you see vengeance—
CORNWALL	3	7	2348	2348	1	2	My villain?
CORNWALL	3	7	2353	2354	2	19	Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!<br>Where is thy luster now?
CORNWALL	3	7	2368	2371	4	31	I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.—<br>Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave<br>Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.<br>Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
CURAN	2	1	1001	1003	3	29	And you, sir. I have been with your father and<br>given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and<br>Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.
CURAN	2	1	1005	1007	3	23	Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news<br>abroad—I mean the whispered ones, for they are<br>yet but ear-kissing arguments.
CURAN	2	1	1009	1010	2	15	Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt<br>the dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
CURAN	2	1	1012	1012	1	10	You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
DOCTOR-LR	4	7	3063	3063	1	3	Madam, sleeps still.
DOCTOR-LR	4	7	3068	3070	3	14	So please your Majesty<br>That we may wake the King? He hath slept<br>long.
DOCTOR-LR	4	7	3075	3076	2	15	Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.<br>I doubt not of his temperance.

FOOL-LR	1	4	709	711	3	23	Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer.<br>You gave me nothing for ’t.—Can you make no use<br>of nothing, nuncle?
FOOL-LR	1	4	714	715	2	18	Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his<br>land comes to. He will not believe a Fool.

FOOL-LR	1	4	732	736	5	50	No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If<br>I had a monopoly out, they would have part on ’t.<br>And ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool<br>to myself; they’ll be snatching.—Nuncle, give me<br>an egg, and I’ll give thee two crowns.
FOOL-LR	1	4	738	745	12	103	Why, after I have cut the egg i’ th’ middle and eat<br>up the meat, the two crowns of the egg.

GENTLEMAN	4	3	2601	2606	6	40	Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my<br>presence,<br>And now and then an ample tear trilled down<br>Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen<br>Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,<br>Fought to be king o’er her.
GENTLEMAN	4	3	2608	2616	9	72	Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove<br>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br>Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears<br>Were like a better way.

GENTLEMAN	4	6	2953	2953	1	9	You are a royal one, and we obey you.
GENTLEMAN	4	6	2956	2959	4	31	A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,<br>Past speaking of in a king. Thou hast a daughter<br>Who redeems nature from the general curse<br>Which twain have brought her to.
GENTLEMAN	4	6	2961	2961	1	6	Sir, speed you. What’s your will?
GENTLEMAN	4	6	2963	2964	2	11	Most sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that,<br>Which can distinguish sound.

GENTLEMAN	4	7	3151	3151	1	6	Who is conductor of his people?
GENTLEMAN	4	7	3153	3154	2	14	They say Edgar, his banished son, is with<br>the Earl of Kent in Germany.

GENTLEMAN	5	3	3511	3511	1	4	Help, help, O, help!
GENTLEMAN	5	3	3515	3516	2	14	’Tis hot, it smokes! It came even from the heart<br>Of—O, she’s dead!
GENTLEMAN	5	3	3518	3519	2	15	Your lady, sir, your lady. And her sister<br>By her is poisoned. She confesses it.

GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	13	16	4	32	Sir, this young fellow’s mother could,<br>whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,<br>sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband<br>for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	19	25	7	62	But I have a son, sir, by order of law,<br>some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in<br>my account. Though this knave came something<br>saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was<br>his mother fair, there was good sport at his making,<br>and the whoreson must be acknowledged.—Do you<br>know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	214	214	1	7	Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	27	28	2	11	My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter<br>as my honorable friend.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	3	7	5	40	It did always seem so to us, but now in<br>the division of the kingdom, it appears not which<br>of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so<br>weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice<br>of either’s moiety.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	32	33	2	16	He hath been out nine years, and away he<br>shall again. The King is coming.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	36	36	1	4	I shall, my lord.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	1	9	11	3	23	His breeding, sir, hath been at my<br>charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge<br>him that now I am brazed to ’t.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	379	382	4	30	Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted?<br>And the King gone tonight, prescribed his power,<br>Confined to exhibition? All this done<br>Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now? What news?

GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	387	387	1	5	What paper were you reading?
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	389	392	4	35	No? What needed then that terrible dispatch<br>of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing<br>hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come, if<br>it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	397	397	1	5	Give me the letter, sir.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	401	401	1	4	Let’s see, let’s see.
GLOUCESTER-LR	1	2	404	406	13	127	<span class="letter" data-words="88">This policy and reverence of age<br>makes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps<br>our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish<br>them.

This villain<br>of mine comes under the prediction: there’s son<br>against father. The King falls from bias of nature:<br>there’s father against child. We have seen the best of<br>our time.

GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1050	1051	2	11	Pursue him, ho! Go after. By no<br>means what?
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1065	1072	8	55	Let him fly far!<br>Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,<br>And found—dispatch. The noble duke my master,<br>My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.<br>By his authority I will proclaim it<br>That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,<br>Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;<br>He that conceals him, death.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1088	1098	11	78	O strange and fastened villain!<br>Would he deny his letter, said he?<br>I never got him.<br>Hark, the Duke’s trumpets. I know not why he<br>comes.<br>All ports I’ll bar. The villain shall not ’scape.<br>The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture<br>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom<br>May have due note of him. And of my land,<br>Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means<br>To make thee capable.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1105	1105	1	9	O madam, my old heart is cracked; it’s cracked.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1108	1108	1	8	O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1111	1111	1	9	I know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1124	1125	2	15	He did bewray his practice, and received<br>This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1127	1127	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1137	1137	1	6	For him I thank your Grace.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	1	1149	1150	2	9	I serve you, madam.<br>Your Graces are right welcome.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	2	1198	1198	1	6	Weapons? Arms? What’s the matter here?
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	2	1240	1240	1	6	How fell you out? Say that.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	2	1303	1310	8	63	Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.<br>His fault is much, and the good king his master<br>Will check him for ’t. Your purposed low correction<br>Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches<br>For pilf’rings and most common trespasses<br>Are punished with. The King must take it ill<br>That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,<br>Should have him thus restrained.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	2	1316	1319	4	27	I am sorry for thee, friend. ’Tis the Duke’s<br>pleasure,<br>Whose disposition all the world well knows<br>Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I’ll entreat for thee.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	2	1324	1324	1	10	The Duke’s to blame in this. ’Twill be ill taken.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1459	1462	4	21	My dear lord,<br>You know the fiery quality of the Duke,<br>How unremovable and fixed he is<br>In his own course.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1467	1467	1	9	Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1470	1470	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1494	1494	1	7	I would have all well betwixt you.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1698	1698	1	6	The King is in high rage.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1700	1700	1	10	He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
GLOUCESTER-LR	2	4	1703	1705	3	20	Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds<br>Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about<br>There’s scarce a bush.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	3	1879	1884	6	49	Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this<br>unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I<br>might pity him, they took from me the use of mine<br>own house, charged me on pain of perpetual<br>displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for<br>him, or any way sustain him.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	3	1886	1898	13	126	Go to; say you nothing. There is division<br>between the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I<br>have received a letter this night; ’tis dangerous to<br>be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet.<br>These injuries the King now bears will be revenged<br>home; there is part of a power already footed. We<br>must incline to the King. I will look him and privily<br>relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the<br>Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he<br>ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as<br>no less is threatened me, the King my old master<br>must be relieved. There is strange things toward,<br>Edmund. Pray you, be careful.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2038	2038	1	6	What are you there? Your names?
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2053	2053	1	7	What, hath your Grace no better company?
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2056	2057	2	17	Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile<br>That it doth hate what gets it.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2059	2064	6	52	Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer<br>T’ obey in all your daughters’ hard commands.<br>Though their injunction be to bar my doors<br>And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,<br>Yet have I ventured to come seek you out<br>And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2074	2084	11	84	Canst thou blame him?<br>His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!<br>He said it would be thus, poor banished man.<br>Thou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee,<br>friend,<br>I am almost mad myself. I had a son,<br>Now outlawed from my blood. He sought my life<br>But lately, very late. I loved him, friend,<br>No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,<br>The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night’s this!<br>—I do beseech your Grace—
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2088	2088	1	9	In fellow, there, into th’ hovel. Keep thee warm.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2094	2094	1	4	Take him you on.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	4	2097	2097	1	5	No words, no words. Hush.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	6	2127	2129	3	28	Here is better than the open air. Take it<br>thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what<br>addition I can. I will not be long from you.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	6	2217	2217	1	9	Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	6	2219	2229	11	82	Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms.<br>I have o’erheard a plot of death upon him.<br>There is a litter ready; lay him in ’t,<br>And drive toward Dover, friend, where thou shalt<br>meet<br>Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.<br>If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,<br>With thine and all that offer to defend him,<br>Stand in assurèd loss. Take up, take up,<br>And follow me, that will to some provision<br>Give thee quick conduct.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	6	2236	2236	1	3	Come, come away.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2287	2289	3	18	What means your Graces? Good my friends,<br>consider<br>You are my guests; do me no foul play, friends.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2292	2292	1	7	Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2295	2296	2	14	By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done<br>To pluck me by the beard.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2298	2302	5	35	Naughty lady,<br>These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin<br>Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host;<br>With robber’s hands my hospitable favors<br>You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2309	2311	3	21	I have a letter guessingly set down<br>Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,<br>And not from one opposed.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2315	2315	1	2	To Dover.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2319	2319	1	12	I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2321	2331	12	91	Because I would not see thy cruel nails<br>Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister<br>In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.<br>The sea, with such a storm as his bare head<br>In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up<br>And quenched the stellèd fires;<br>Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.<br>If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time,<br>Thou shouldst have said <span class="quote" data-words="5">Good porter, turn thekey.</span><br>All cruels else subscribe. But I shall see<br>The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2335	2337	3	31	He that will think to live till he be old,<br>Give me some help!<br>O cruel! O you gods!
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2355	2358	4	20	All dark and comfortless! Where’s my son<br>Edmund?—<br>Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature<br>To quit this horrid act.
GLOUCESTER-LR	3	7	2363	2364	2	15	O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.<br>Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2396	2398	3	20	Away, get thee away. Good friend, begone.<br>Thy comforts can do me no good at all;<br>Thee they may hurt.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2400	2406	7	56	I have no way and therefore want no eyes.<br>I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen<br>Our means secure us, and our mere defects<br>Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,<br>The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath,<br>Might I but live to see thee in my touch,<br>I’d say I had eyes again.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2414	2414	1	4	Is it a beggar-man?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2416	2423	8	65	He has some reason, else he could not beg.<br>I’ th’ last night’s storm, I such a fellow saw,<br>Which made me think a man a worm. My son<br>Came then into my mind, and yet my mind<br>Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard<br>more since.<br>As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods;<br>They kill us for their sport.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2427	2427	1	5	Is that the naked fellow?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2429	2433	5	42	Then, prithee, get thee away. If for my sake<br>Thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain<br>I’ th’ way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,<br>And bring some covering for this naked soul,<br>Which I’ll entreat to lead me.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2435	2437	3	23	’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.<br>Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.<br>Above the rest, begone.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2440	2440	1	3	Sirrah, naked fellow—
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2442	2442	1	3	Come hither, fellow.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2444	2444	1	6	Know’st thou the way to Dover?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2454	2462	9	63	Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens’<br>plagues<br>Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched<br>Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still:<br>Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,<br>That slaves your ordinance, that will not see<br>Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly.<br>So distribution should undo excess<br>And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	1	2464	2469	6	45	There is a cliff, whose high and bending head<br>Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep.<br>Bring me but to the very brim of it,<br>And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear<br>With something rich about me. From that place<br>I shall no leading need.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2733	2733	1	11	When shall I come to th’ top of that same hill?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2735	2735	1	5	Methinks the ground is even.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2738	2738	1	2	No, truly.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2741	2743	3	21	So may it be indeed.<br>Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak’st<br>In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2746	2746	1	4	Methinks you’re better spoken.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2762	2762	1	5	Set me where you stand.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2766	2771	6	44	Let go my hand.<br>Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel<br>Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods<br>Prosper it with thee.<br>Go thou further off.<br>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2773	2773	1	4	With all my heart.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2776	2783	8	59	O you mighty gods!<br>This world I do renounce, and in your sights<br>Shake patiently my great affliction off.<br>If I could bear it longer, and not fall<br>To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br>My snuff and loathèd part of nature should<br>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!—<br>Now, fellow, fare thee well.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2792	2792	1	5	Away, and let me die.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2802	2802	1	6	But have I fall’n or no?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2806	2810	5	31	Alack, I have no eyes.<br>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit<br>To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort<br>When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage<br>And frustrate his proud will.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2813	2813	1	4	Too well, too well.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2817	2817	1	4	A poor unfortunate beggar.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2825	2829	5	42	I do remember now. Henceforth I’ll bear<br>Affliction till it do cry out itself<br><span class="quote" data-words="2">Enough, enough!</span> and die. That thing you speak of,<br>I took it for a man. Often ’twould say<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">The fiend, the fiend!</span> He led me to that place.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2846	2846	1	4	I know that voice.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2857	2858	2	14	The trick of that voice I do well remember.<br>Is ’t not the King?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2879	2879	1	6	O, let me kiss that hand!
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2881	2882	2	18	O ruined piece of nature! This great world<br>Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2887	2887	1	9	Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2891	2891	1	6	What, with the case of eyes?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2896	2896	1	4	I see it feelingly.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2903	2903	1	2	Ay, sir.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2931	2931	1	4	Alack, alack the day!
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2973	2975	3	21	You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;<br>Let not my worser spirit tempt me again<br>To die before you please.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2977	2977	1	6	Now, good sir, what are you?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2982	2984	3	13	Hearty thanks.<br>The bounty and the benison of heaven<br>To boot, and boot.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	2990	2991	2	10	Now let thy friendly hand<br>Put strength enough to ’t.
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	3015	3015	1	4	What, is he dead?
GLOUCESTER-LR	4	6	3040	3045	6	45	The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense<br>That I stand up and have ingenious feeling<br>Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.<br>So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs,<br>And woes, by wrong imaginations, lose<br>The knowledge of themselves.
GLOUCESTER-LR	5	2	3242	3242	1	5	Grace go with you, sir.
GLOUCESTER-LR	5	2	3246	3246	1	9	No further, sir. A man may rot even here.
GLOUCESTER-LR	5	2	3250	3250	1	4	And that’s true too.
GONERIL	1	1	321	324	4	29	Let your study<br>Be to content your lord, who hath received you<br>At Fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted<br>And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
GONERIL	1	1	329	331	3	24	Sister, it is not little I have to say of what<br>most nearly appertains to us both. I think our<br>father will hence tonight.
GONERIL	1	1	334	338	5	40	You see how full of changes his age is; the<br>observation we have made of it hath not been<br>little. He always loved our sister most, and with<br>what poor judgment he hath now cast her off<br>appears too grossly.
GONERIL	1	1	341	346	6	40	The best and soundest of his time hath been<br>but rash. Then must we look from his age to<br>receive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed<br>condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness<br>that infirm and choleric years bring with<br>them.
GONERIL	1	1	349	353	5	36	There is further compliment of leave-taking<br>between France and him. Pray you, let us sit<br>together. If our father carry authority with such<br>disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will<br>but offend us.
GONERIL	1	1	355	355	1	8	We must do something, and i’ th’ heat.
GONERIL	1	1	60	67	8	61	Sir, I love you more than word can wield the<br>matter,<br>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,<br>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,<br>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;<br>As much as child e’er loved, or father found;<br>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.<br>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
GONERIL	1	3	548	549	2	11	Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding<br>of his Fool?
GONERIL	1	3	551	558	8	70	By day and night he wrongs me. Every hour<br>He flashes into one gross crime or other<br>That sets us all at odds. I’ll not endure it.<br>His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us<br>On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,<br>I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.<br>If you come slack of former services,<br>You shall do well. The fault of it I’ll answer.
GONERIL	1	3	560	570	11	81	Put on what weary negligence you please,<br>You and your fellows. I’d have it come to question.<br>If he distaste it, let him to my sister,<br>Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,<br>Not to be overruled. Idle old man<br>That still would manage those authorities<br>That he hath given away. Now, by my life,<br>Old fools are babes again and must be used<br>With checks as flatteries, when they are seen<br>abused.<br>Remember what I have said.
GONERIL	1	3	572	576	5	46	And let his knights have colder looks among you.<br>What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.<br>I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,<br>That I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister<br>To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
GONERIL	1	4	782	795	14	108	Not only, sir, this your all-licensed Fool,<br>But other of your insolent retinue<br>Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth<br>In rank and not-to-be-endurèd riots. Sir,<br>I had thought by making this well known unto you<br>To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,<br>By what yourself too late have spoke and done,<br>That you protect this course and put it on<br>By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br>Would not ’scape censure, nor the redresses sleep<br>Which in the tender of a wholesome weal<br>Might in their working do you that offense,<br>Which else were shame, that then necessity<br>Will call discreet proceeding.
GONERIL	1	4	801	804	4	31	I would you would make use of your good wisdom,<br>Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away<br>These dispositions which of late transport you<br>From what you rightly are.
GONERIL	1	4	820	835	16	124	This admiration, sir, is much o’ th’ savor<br>Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you<br>To understand my purposes aright.<br>As you are old and reverend, should be wise.<br>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,<br>Men so disordered, so debauched and bold,<br>That this our court, infected with their manners,<br>Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust<br>Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel<br>Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak<br>For instant remedy. Be then desired,<br>By her that else will take the thing she begs,<br>A little to disquantity your train,<br>And the remainders that shall still depend<br>To be such men as may besort your age,<br>Which know themselves and you.
GONERIL	1	4	841	842	2	13	You strike my people, and your disordered rabble<br>Make servants of their betters.
GONERIL	1	4	881	883	3	19	Never afflict yourself to know more of it,<br>But let his disposition have that scope<br>As dotage gives it.
GONERIL	1	4	904	904	1	4	Do you mark that?
GONERIL	1	4	907	908	2	15	Pray you, content.—What, Oswald, ho!—<br>You, sir, more knave than Fool, after your master.
GONERIL	1	4	916	923	8	51	This man hath had good counsel. A hundred<br>knights!<br>’Tis politic and safe to let him keep<br>At point a hundred knights! Yes, that on every<br>dream,<br>Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,<br>He may enguard his dotage with their powers<br>And hold our lives in mercy.—Oswald, I say!
GONERIL	1	4	925	932	8	63	Safer than trust too far.<br>Let me still take away the harms I fear,<br>Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.<br>What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.<br>If she sustain him and his hundred knights<br>When I have showed th’ unfitness—<br>How now, Oswald?<br>What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
GONERIL	1	4	934	943	10	70	Take you some company and away to horse.<br>Inform her full of my particular fear,<br>And thereto add such reasons of your own<br>As may compact it more. Get you gone,<br>And hasten your return. No, no, my<br>lord,<br>This milky gentleness and course of yours,<br>Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,<br>You are much more at task for want of wisdom<br>Than praised for harmful mildness.
GONERIL	1	4	946	946	1	2	Nay, then—
GONERIL	2	4	1584	1586	3	20	Why not by th’ hand, sir? How have I offended?<br>All’s not offense that indiscretion finds<br>And dotage terms so.
GONERIL	2	4	1610	1610	1	4	At your choice, sir.
GONERIL	2	4	1638	1639	2	17	Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br>From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
GONERIL	2	4	1659	1662	4	26	Hear me, my lord.<br>What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,<br>To follow in a house where twice so many<br>Have a command to tend you?
GONERIL	2	4	1691	1692	2	15	’Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,<br>And must needs taste his folly.
GONERIL	2	4	1695	1695	1	10	So am I purposed. Where is my lord of Gloucester?
GONERIL	2	4	1702	1702	1	9	My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
GONERIL	3	7	2258	2258	1	4	Pluck out his eyes.
GONERIL	3	7	2275	2275	1	5	Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
GONERIL	4	2	2472	2474	3	22	Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband<br>Not met us on the way.<br>Now, where’s your master?
GONERIL	4	2	2485	2500	16	121	Then shall you go no further.<br>It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br>That dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs<br>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.<br>Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.<br>I must change names at home and give the distaff<br>Into my husband’s hands. This trusty servant<br>Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to<br>hear—<br>If you dare venture in your own behalf—<br>A mistress’s command. Wear this; spare speech.<br>Decline your head. This kiss, if it<br>durst speak,<br>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.<br>Conceive, and fare thee well.
GONERIL	4	2	2502	2506	5	23	My most dear<br>Gloucester!<br>O, the difference of man and man!<br>To thee a woman’s services are due;<br>My fool usurps my body.
GONERIL	4	2	2508	2508	1	6	I have been worth the whistle.
GONERIL	4	2	2517	2517	1	6	No more. The text is foolish.
GONERIL	4	2	2533	2543	11	76	Milk-livered man,<br>That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br>Thine honor from thy suffering; that not know’st<br>Fools do those villains pity who are punished<br>Ere they have done their mischief. Where’s thy<br>drum?<br>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land.<br>With plumèd helm thy state begins to threat<br>Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries<br><span class="quote" data-words="5">Alack, why does he so?</span>
GONERIL	4	2	2547	2547	1	3	O vain fool!
GONERIL	4	2	2554	2554	1	4	Marry, your manhood, mew—
GONERIL	4	2	2573	2577	5	38	One way I like this well.<br>But being widow and my Gloucester with her<br>May all the building in my fancy pluck<br>Upon my hateful life. Another way<br>The news is not so tart.—I’ll read, and answer.
GONERIL	5	1	3181	3182	2	14	I had rather lose the battle than that sister<br>Should loosen him and me.
GONERIL	5	1	3193	3195	3	16	Combine together ’gainst the enemy,<br>For these domestic and particular broils<br>Are not the question here.
GONERIL	5	1	3200	3200	1	1	No.
GONERIL	5	1	3202	3202	1	8	Oho, I know the riddle.—I will go.
GONERIL	5	3	3327	3329	3	16	Not so hot.<br>In his own grace he doth exalt himself<br>More than in your addition.
GONERIL	5	3	3332	3332	1	9	That were the most if he should husband you.
GONERIL	5	3	3334	3335	2	11	Holla, holla!<br>That eye that told you so looked but asquint.
GONERIL	5	3	3343	3343	1	5	Mean you to enjoy him?
GONERIL	5	3	3357	3357	1	2	An interlude!
GONERIL	5	3	3366	3366	1	6	If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.
GONERIL	5	3	3431	3434	4	26	This is practice, Gloucester.<br>By th’ law of war, thou wast not bound to answer<br>An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquished,<br>But cozened and beguiled.
GONERIL	5	3	3439	3440	2	16	Say if I do; the laws are mine, not thine.<br>Who can arraign me for ’t?
GONERIL	5	3	3443	3443	1	6	Ask me not what I know.

HERALD	5	3	3388	3388	1	1	Again!
HERALD	5	3	3389	3389	1	1	Again!
HERALD	5	3	3392	3394	3	14	What are you?<br>Your name, your quality, and why you answer<br>This present summons?
KENT-LR	1	1	1	2	2	13	I thought the King had more affected the Duke<br>of Albany than Cornwall.
KENT-LR	1	1	12	12	1	4	I cannot conceive you.
KENT-LR	1	1	134	134	1	3	Good my liege—
KENT-LR	1	1	156	159	4	27	Royal Lear,<br>Whom I have ever honored as my king,<br>Loved as my father, as my master followed,<br>As my great patron thought on in my prayers—
KENT-LR	1	1	161	173	13	84	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br>The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly<br>When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br>Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak<br>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s<br>bound<br>When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,<br>And in thy best consideration check<br>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my<br>judgment,<br>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,<br>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds<br>Reverb no hollowness.
KENT-LR	1	1	17	18	2	13	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it<br>being so proper.
KENT-LR	1	1	175	178	4	23	My life I never held but as a pawn<br>To wage against thine enemies, nor fear to lose<br>it,<br>Thy safety being motive.
KENT-LR	1	1	180	181	2	14	See better, Lear, and let me still remain<br>The true blank of thine eye.
KENT-LR	1	1	183	184	2	10	Now, by Apollo, king,<br>Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.
KENT-LR	1	1	187	190	4	29	Kill thy physician, and thy fee bestow<br>Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,<br>Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,<br>I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.
KENT-LR	1	1	204	213	10	73	Fare thee well, king. Sith thus thou wilt appear,<br>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.<br>The gods to their dear shelter take<br>thee, maid,<br>That justly think’st and hast most rightly said.<br>And your large speeches<br>may your deeds approve,<br>That good effects may spring from words of love.—<br>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.<br>He’ll shape his old course in a country new.
KENT-LR	1	1	30	30	1	10	I must love you and sue to know you better.
KENT-LR	1	1	8	8	1	7	Is not this your son, my lord?
KENT-LR	1	4	577	584	8	57	If but as well I other accents borrow<br>That can my speech diffuse, my good intent<br>May carry through itself to that full issue<br>For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,<br>If thou canst serve where thou dost stand<br>condemned,<br>So may it come thy master, whom thou lov’st,<br>Shall find thee full of labors.
KENT-LR	1	4	587	587	1	3	A man, sir.
KENT-LR	1	4	590	594	5	50	I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve<br>him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that<br>is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says<br>little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot<br>choose, and to eat no fish.
KENT-LR	1	4	596	597	2	10	A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the<br>King.
KENT-LR	1	4	600	600	1	1	Service.
KENT-LR	1	4	602	602	1	1	You.
KENT-LR	1	4	604	605	2	15	No, sir, but you have that in your countenance<br>which I would fain call master.
KENT-LR	1	4	607	607	1	1	Authority.
KENT-LR	1	4	609	612	4	38	I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a<br>curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message<br>bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for I<br>am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.
KENT-LR	1	4	614	616	3	26	Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing,<br>nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years<br>on my back forty-eight.
KENT-LR	1	4	662	663	2	7	Nor tripped neither, you base<br>football player?
KENT-LR	1	4	666	669	4	27	Come, sir, arise. Away. I’ll teach you<br>differences. Away, away. If you will measure your<br>lubber’s length again, tarry. But away. Go to. Have<br>you wisdom? So.
KENT-LR	1	4	708	708	1	4	This is nothing, Fool.
KENT-LR	1	4	731	731	1	7	This is not altogether fool, my lord.
KENT-LR	1	5	953	954	2	12	I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered<br>your letter.
KENT-LR	2	2	1153	1153	1	1	Ay.
KENT-LR	2	2	1155	1155	1	3	I’ th’ mire.
KENT-LR	2	2	1157	1157	1	4	I love thee not.
KENT-LR	2	2	1159	1160	2	14	If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make<br>thee care for me.
KENT-LR	2	2	1162	1162	1	4	Fellow, I know thee.
KENT-LR	2	2	1164	1174	11	78	A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a<br>base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,<br>filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered,<br>action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable,<br>finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting<br>slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good<br>service, and art nothing but the composition of a<br>knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir<br>of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into<br>clamorous whining if thou deny’st the least syllable<br>of thy addition.
KENT-LR	2	2	1178	1184	7	58	What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou<br>knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up<br>thy heels and beat thee before the King?<br>Draw, you rogue, for though it be night,<br>yet the moon shines. I’ll make a sop o’ th’ moonshine<br>of you, you whoreson, cullionly barbermonger.<br>Draw!
KENT-LR	2	2	1186	1190	5	37	Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against<br>the King and take Vanity the puppet’s part against<br>the royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so<br>carbonado your shanks! Draw, you rascal! Come<br>your ways.
KENT-LR	2	2	1192	1193	2	10	Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat<br>slave! Strike!
KENT-LR	2	2	1196	1197	2	15	With you, goodman boy, if you please. Come, I’ll<br>flesh you. Come on, young master.
KENT-LR	2	2	1204	1206	3	19	No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor.<br>You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a<br>tailor made thee.
KENT-LR	2	2	1209	1211	3	25	A tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not<br>have made him so ill, though they had been but two<br>years o’ th’ trade.
KENT-LR	2	2	1215	1219	5	37	Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!<br>—My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread<br>this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall<br>of a jakes with him.—Spare my gray beard, you<br>wagtail?
KENT-LR	2	2	1222	1222	1	7	Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
KENT-LR	2	2	1224	1238	15	104	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,<br>Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as<br>these,<br>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain<br>Which are too intrinse t’ unloose; smooth every<br>passion<br>That in the natures of their lords rebel,<br>Being oil to fire, snow to the colder moods,<br>Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br>With every gale and vary of their masters,<br>Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.—<br>A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br>Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br>Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,<br>I’d drive you cackling home to Camelot.
KENT-LR	2	2	1241	1242	2	11	No contraries hold more antipathy<br>Than I and such a knave.
KENT-LR	2	2	1244	1244	1	5	His countenance likes me not.
KENT-LR	2	2	1246	1249	4	28	Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:<br>I have seen better faces in my time<br>Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br>Before me at this instant.
KENT-LR	2	2	1261	1264	4	26	Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,<br>Under th’ allowance of your great aspect,<br>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br>On flick’ring Phoebus’ front—
KENT-LR	2	2	1266	1270	5	49	To go out of my dialect, which you discommend<br>so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that<br>beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave,<br>which for my part I will not be, though I should<br>win your displeasure to entreat me to ’t.
KENT-LR	2	2	1283	1284	2	11	None of these rogues and cowards<br>But Ajax is their fool.
KENT-LR	2	2	1288	1294	7	45	Sir, I am too old to learn.<br>Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King,<br>On whose employment I was sent to you.<br>You shall do small respect, show too bold<br>malice<br>Against the grace and person of my master,<br>Stocking his messenger.
KENT-LR	2	2	1298	1299	2	14	Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,<br>You should not use me so.
KENT-LR	2	2	1320	1323	4	33	Pray, do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard.<br>Some time I shall sleep out; the rest I’ll whistle.<br>A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels.<br>Give you good morrow.
KENT-LR	2	2	1325	1339	15	98	Good king, that must approve the common saw,<br>Thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st<br>To the warm sun.<br>Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,<br>That by thy comfortable beams I may<br>Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles<br>But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,<br>Who hath most fortunately been informed<br>Of my obscurèd course, and shall find time<br>From this enormous state, seeking to give<br>Losses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatched,<br>Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold<br>This shameful lodging.<br>Fortune, good night. Smile once more; turn thy<br>wheel.
KENT-LR	2	4	1366	1366	1	5	Hail to thee, noble master.
KENT-LR	2	4	1369	1369	1	3	No, my lord.
KENT-LR	2	4	1377	1378	2	10	It is both he and she,<br>Your son and daughter.
KENT-LR	2	4	1380	1380	1	1	Yes.
KENT-LR	2	4	1382	1382	1	3	I say yea.
KENT-LR	2	4	1384	1384	1	5	By Juno, I swear ay.
KENT-LR	2	4	1392	1411	20	136	My lord, when at their home<br>I did commend your Highness’ letters to them,<br>Ere I was risen from the place that showed<br>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,<br>Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth<br>From Goneril his mistress salutations;<br>Delivered letters, spite of intermission,<br>Which presently they read; on whose contents<br>They summoned up their meiny, straight took<br>horse,<br>Commanded me to follow and attend<br>The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks;<br>And meeting here the other messenger,<br>Whose welcome, I perceived, had poisoned mine,<br>Being the very fellow which of late<br>Displayed so saucily against your Highness,<br>Having more man than wit about me, drew.<br>He raised the house with loud and coward cries.<br>Your son and daughter found this trespass worth<br>The shame which here it suffers.
KENT-LR	2	4	1425	1425	1	6	With the Earl, sir, here within.
KENT-LR	2	4	1429	1430	2	11	None.<br>How chance the King comes with so small a number?
KENT-LR	2	4	1433	1433	1	2	Why, Fool?
KENT-LR	2	4	1452	1452	1	5	Where learned you this, Fool?
KENT-LR	3	1	1714	1714	1	5	Who’s there, besides foul weather?
KENT-LR	3	1	1716	1716	1	6	I know you. Where’s the King?
KENT-LR	3	1	1731	1731	1	5	But who is with him?
KENT-LR	3	1	1734	1759	26	203	Sir, I do know you<br>And dare upon the warrant of my note<br>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,<br>Although as yet the face of it is covered<br>With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall,<br>Who have—as who have not, that their great stars<br>Throned and set high?—servants, who seem no less,<br>Which are to France the spies and speculations<br>Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,<br>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,<br>Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne<br>Against the old kind king, or something deeper,<br>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings—<br>But true it is, from France there comes a power<br>Into this scattered kingdom, who already,<br>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br>In some of our best ports and are at point<br>To show their open banner. Now to you:<br>If on my credit you dare build so far<br>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br>Some that will thank you, making just report<br>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br>The King hath cause to plain.<br>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,<br>And from some knowledge and assurance offer<br>This office to you.
KENT-LR	3	1	1761	1769	9	69	No, do not.<br>For confirmation that I am much more<br>Than my outwall, open this purse and take<br>What it contains.<br>If you shall see Cordelia<br>(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,<br>And she will tell you who that fellow is<br>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br>I will go seek the King.
KENT-LR	3	1	1771	1775	5	33	Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:<br>That when we have found the King—in which your<br>pain<br>That way, I’ll this—he that first lights on him<br>Holla the other.
KENT-LR	3	2	1816	1816	1	2	Who’s there?
KENT-LR	3	2	1819	1826	8	66	Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night<br>Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies<br>Gallow the very wanderers of the dark<br>And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,<br>Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,<br>Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never<br>Remember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carry<br>Th’ affliction nor the fear.
KENT-LR	3	2	1839	1847	9	55	Alack,<br>bareheaded?<br>Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel.<br>Some friendship will it lend you ’gainst the tempest.<br>Repose you there while I to this hard house—<br>More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised,<br>Which even but now, demanding after you,<br>Denied me to come in—return and force<br>Their scanted courtesy.
KENT-LR	3	4	1904	1906	3	22	Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.<br>The tyranny of the open night’s too rough<br>For nature to endure.
KENT-LR	3	4	1908	1908	1	5	Good my lord, enter here.
KENT-LR	3	4	1910	1910	1	10	I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
KENT-LR	3	4	1929	1929	1	5	Good my lord, enter here.
KENT-LR	3	4	1949	1949	1	6	Give me thy hand. Who’s there?
KENT-LR	3	4	1951	1952	2	12	What art thou that dost grumble there i’ th’<br>straw? Come forth.
KENT-LR	3	4	1978	1978	1	5	He hath no daughters, sir.
KENT-LR	3	4	2035	2035	1	4	How fares your Grace?
KENT-LR	3	4	2037	2037	1	7	Who’s there? What is ’t you seek?
KENT-LR	3	4	2067	2067	1	10	Good my lord, take his offer; go into th’ house.
KENT-LR	3	4	2072	2073	2	13	Importune him once more to go, my lord.<br>His wits begin t’ unsettle.
KENT-LR	3	4	2090	2090	1	4	This way, my lord.
KENT-LR	3	4	2093	2093	1	10	Good my lord, soothe him. Let him take the fellow.
KENT-LR	3	4	2095	2095	1	7	Sirrah, come on: go along with us.
KENT-LR	3	6	2130	2131	2	17	All the power of his wits have given way to his<br>impatience. The gods reward your kindness!
KENT-LR	3	6	2161	2162	2	18	How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed.<br>Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
KENT-LR	3	6	2187	2188	2	16	O pity! Sir, where is the patience now<br>That you so oft have boasted to retain?
KENT-LR	3	6	2212	2212	1	9	Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
KENT-LR	3	6	2218	2218	1	10	Here, sir, but trouble him not; his wits are gone.
KENT-LR	3	6	2230	2235	6	36	Oppressèd nature sleeps.<br>This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews,<br>Which, if convenience will not allow,<br>Stand in hard cure. Come, help to<br>bear thy master.<br>Thou must not stay behind.
KENT-LR	4	3	2590	2591	2	14	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone<br>back know you no reason?
KENT-LR	4	3	2597	2597	1	7	Who hath he left behind him general?
KENT-LR	4	3	2599	2600	2	11	Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration<br>of grief?
KENT-LR	4	3	2607	2607	1	5	O, then it moved her.
KENT-LR	4	3	2617	2617	1	5	Made she no verbal question?
KENT-LR	4	3	2627	2631	5	29	It is the stars.<br>The stars above us govern our conditions,<br>Else one self mate and make could not beget<br>Such different issues. You spoke not with her<br>since?
KENT-LR	4	3	2633	2633	1	6	Was this before the King returned?
KENT-LR	4	3	2635	2638	4	31	Well, sir, the poor distressèd Lear’s i’ th’ town,<br>Who sometime in his better tune remembers<br>What we are come about, and by no means<br>Will yield to see his daughter.
KENT-LR	4	3	2640	2646	7	42	A sovereign shame so elbows him—his own<br>unkindness,<br>That stripped her from his benediction, turned her<br>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br>To his dog-hearted daughters—these things sting<br>His mind so venomously that burning shame<br>Detains him from Cordelia.
KENT-LR	4	3	2648	2648	1	8	Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?
KENT-LR	4	3	2650	2655	6	45	Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear<br>And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause<br>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.<br>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve<br>Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go<br>Along with me.
KENT-LR	4	7	3052	3054	3	20	To be acknowledged, madam, is o’erpaid.<br>All my reports go with the modest truth,<br>Nor more, nor clipped, but so.
KENT-LR	4	7	3058	3061	4	27	Pardon, dear madam.<br>Yet to be known shortens my made intent.<br>My boon I make it that you know me not<br>Till time and I think meet.
KENT-LR	4	7	3083	3083	1	4	Kind and dear princess.
KENT-LR	4	7	3137	3137	1	5	In your own kingdom, sir.
KENT-LR	4	7	3150	3150	1	3	Most certain, sir.
KENT-LR	4	7	3152	3152	1	8	As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
KENT-LR	4	7	3155	3156	2	15	Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about.<br>The powers of the kingdom approach apace.
KENT-LR	4	7	3159	3160	2	17	My point and period will be throughly wrought,<br>Or well, or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.
KENT-LR	5	3	3529	3531	3	15	I am come<br>To bid my king and master aye goodnight.<br>Is he not here?
KENT-LR	5	3	3536	3536	1	3	Alack, why thus?
KENT-LR	5	3	3566	3566	1	5	Is this the promised end?
KENT-LR	5	3	3572	3572	1	4	O, my good master—
KENT-LR	5	3	3588	3589	2	14	If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated,<br>One of them we behold.
KENT-LR	5	3	3591	3592	2	10	The same,<br>Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
KENT-LR	5	3	3595	3595	1	9	No, my good lord, I am the very man—
KENT-LR	5	3	3597	3598	2	13	That from your first of difference and decay<br>Have followed your sad steps.
KENT-LR	5	3	3601	3603	3	19	Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.<br>Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,<br>And desperately are dead.
KENT-LR	5	3	3628	3628	1	5	Break, heart, I prithee, break!
KENT-LR	5	3	3630	3632	3	24	Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him<br>That would upon the rack of this tough world<br>Stretch him out longer.
KENT-LR	5	3	3634	3635	2	13	The wonder is he hath endured so long.<br>He but usurped his life.
KENT-LR	5	3	3640	3641	2	17	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;<br>My master calls me. I must not say no.
KNIGHT	1	4	627	627	1	9	He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
KNIGHT	1	4	630	631	2	11	Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner,<br>he would not.
KNIGHT	1	4	633	638	6	48	My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to<br>my judgment your Highness is not entertained<br>with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.<br>There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as<br>well in the general dependents as in the Duke<br>himself also, and your daughter.
KNIGHT	1	4	640	642	3	23	I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be<br>mistaken, for my duty cannot be silent when I think<br>your Highness wronged.
KNIGHT	1	4	649	650	2	14	Since my young lady’s going into France, sir,<br>the Fool hath much pined away.
MESSENGER	4	2	2556	2558	3	22	O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead,<br>Slain by his servant, going to put out<br>The other eye of Gloucester.
MESSENGER	4	2	2560	2565	6	43	A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,<br>Opposed against the act, bending his sword<br>To his great master, who, thereat enraged,<br>Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead,<br>But not without that harmful stroke which since<br>Hath plucked him after.
MESSENGER	4	2	2570	2572	3	19	Both, both, my lord.—<br>This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.<br>’Tis from your sister.
MESSENGER	4	2	2579	2579	1	5	Come with my lady hither.
MESSENGER	4	2	2581	2581	1	9	No, my good lord. I met him back again.
MESSENGER	4	2	2583	2585	3	23	Ay, my good lord. ’Twas he informed against him<br>And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br>Might have the freer course.
MESSENGER	4	4	2678	2679	2	8	News, madam.<br>The British powers are marching hitherward.
MESSENGER	5	3	3608	3608	1	5	Edmund is dead, my lord.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2394	2395	2	16	O my good lord, I have been your tenant<br>And your father’s tenant these fourscore years.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2399	2399	1	5	You cannot see your way.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2407	2407	1	4	How now? Who’s there?
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2410	2410	1	4	’Tis poor mad Tom.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2413	2413	1	3	Fellow, where goest?
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2415	2415	1	4	Madman and beggar too.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2428	2428	1	3	Ay, my lord.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2434	2434	1	5	Alack, sir, he is mad.
OLD_MAN-LR	4	1	2438	2439	2	14	I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have,<br>Come on ’t what will.
OSWALD	1	3	550	550	1	2	Ay, madam.
OSWALD	1	3	559	559	1	6	He’s coming, madam. I hear him.
OSWALD	1	3	571	571	1	2	Well, madam.
OSWALD	1	4	622	622	1	3	So please you—
OSWALD	1	4	655	655	1	3	My lady’s father.
OSWALD	1	4	658	659	2	11	I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your<br>pardon.
OSWALD	1	4	661	661	1	6	I’ll not be strucken, my lord.
OSWALD	1	4	933	933	1	2	Ay, madam.
OSWALD	2	2	1151	1152	2	9	Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this<br>house?
OSWALD	2	2	1154	1154	1	6	Where may we set our horses?
OSWALD	2	2	1156	1156	1	7	Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me.
OSWALD	2	2	1158	1158	1	7	Why then, I care not for thee.
OSWALD	2	2	1161	1161	1	10	Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
OSWALD	2	2	1163	1163	1	6	What dost thou know me for?
OSWALD	2	2	1175	1177	3	21	Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus<br>to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor<br>knows thee!
OSWALD	2	2	1185	1185	1	8	Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
OSWALD	2	2	1191	1191	1	4	Help, ho! Murder! Help!
OSWALD	2	2	1194	1194	1	4	Help, ho! Murder, murder!
OSWALD	2	2	1203	1203	1	7	I am scarce in breath, my lord.
OSWALD	2	2	1213	1214	2	15	This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have<br>spared at suit of his gray beard—
OSWALD	2	2	1273	1282	10	70	I never gave him any.<br>It pleased the King his master very late<br>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br>When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,<br>Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,<br>And put upon him such a deal of man<br>That worthied him, got praises of the King<br>For him attempting who was self-subdued;<br>And in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br>Drew on me here again.
OSWALD	3	7	2268	2273	6	44	My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.<br>Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,<br>Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,<br>Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents,<br>Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast<br>To have well-armèd friends.
OSWALD	4	2	2475	2484	10	73	Madam, within, but never man so changed.<br>I told him of the army that was landed;<br>He smiled at it. I told him you were coming;<br>His answer was <span class="quote" data-words="2">The worse.</span> Of Gloucester’s<br>treachery<br>And of the loyal service of his son<br>When I informed him, then he called me <span class="quote" data-words="1">sot</span><br>And told me I had turned the wrong side out.<br>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br>What like, offensive.
OSWALD	4	2	2507	2507	1	5	Madam, here comes my lord.
OSWALD	4	5	2689	2689	1	2	Ay, madam.
OSWALD	4	5	2691	2692	2	10	Madam, with much ado.<br>Your sister is the better soldier.
OSWALD	4	5	2694	2694	1	2	No, madam.
OSWALD	4	5	2696	2696	1	4	I know not, lady.
OSWALD	4	5	2704	2704	1	9	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
OSWALD	4	5	2707	2708	2	12	I may not, madam.<br>My lady charged my duty in this business.
OSWALD	4	5	2713	2713	1	4	Madam, I had rather—
OSWALD	4	5	2718	2718	1	2	I, madam?
OSWALD	4	5	2730	2731	2	14	Would I could meet him, madam. I should show<br>What party I do follow.
OSWALD	4	6	2985	2989	5	33	A proclaimed prize! Most happy!<br>That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh<br>To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,<br>Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out<br>That must destroy thee.
OSWALD	4	6	2992	2995	4	26	Wherefore, bold peasant,<br>Dar’st thou support a published traitor? Hence,<br>Lest that th’ infection of his fortune take<br>Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
OSWALD	4	6	2997	2997	1	6	Let go, slave, or thou diest!
OSWALD	4	6	3004	3004	1	2	Out, dunghill.
OSWALD	4	6	3007	3011	5	42	Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.<br>If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,<br>And give the letters which thou find’st about me<br>To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out<br>Upon the English party. O, untimely death! Death!
REGAN	1	1	320	320	1	5	Prescribe not us our duty.
REGAN	1	1	332	333	2	10	That’s most certain, and with you; next month<br>with us.
REGAN	1	1	339	340	2	14	’Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever<br>but slenderly known himself.
REGAN	1	1	347	348	2	15	Such unconstant starts are we like to have<br>from him as this of Kent’s banishment.
REGAN	1	1	354	354	1	6	We shall further think of it.
REGAN	1	1	76	84	9	63	I am made of that self mettle as my sister<br>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br>I find she names my very deed of love;<br>Only she comes too short, that I profess<br>Myself an enemy to all other joys<br>Which the most precious square of sense<br>possesses,<br>And find I am alone felicitate<br>In your dear Highness’ love.
REGAN	2	1	1102	1104	3	18	If it be true, all vengeance comes too short<br>Which can pursue th’ offender. How dost, my<br>lord?
REGAN	2	1	1106	1107	2	15	What, did my father’s godson seek your life?<br>He whom my father named, your Edgar?
REGAN	2	1	1109	1110	2	13	Was he not companion with the riotous knights<br>That tended upon my father?
REGAN	2	1	1113	1119	7	57	No marvel, then, though he were ill affected.<br>’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,<br>To have th’ expense and waste of his revenues.<br>I have this present evening from my sister<br>Been well informed of them, and with such cautions<br>That if they come to sojourn at my house<br>I’ll not be there.
REGAN	2	1	1139	1148	10	72	Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.<br>Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,<br>Wherein we must have use of your advice.<br>Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br>Of differences, which I best thought it fit<br>To answer from our home. The several messengers<br>From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,<br>Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow<br>Your needful counsel to our businesses,<br>Which craves the instant use.
REGAN	2	2	1201	1201	1	8	The messengers from our sister and the King.
REGAN	2	2	1297	1297	1	10	Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night, too.
REGAN	2	2	1300	1300	1	6	Sir, being his knave, I will.
REGAN	2	2	1312	1314	3	22	My sister may receive it much more worse<br>To have her gentleman abused, assaulted<br>For following her affairs.—Put in his legs.
REGAN	2	4	1503	1503	1	7	I am glad to see your Highness.
REGAN	2	4	1514	1516	3	23	I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope<br>You less know how to value her desert<br>Than she to scant her duty.
REGAN	2	4	1518	1522	5	38	I cannot think my sister in the least<br>Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance<br>She have restrained the riots of your followers,<br>’Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end<br>As clears her from all blame.
REGAN	2	4	1524	1530	7	50	O sir, you are old.<br>Nature in you stands on the very verge<br>Of his confine. You should be ruled and led<br>By some discretion that discerns your state<br>Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you<br>That to our sister you do make return.<br>Say you have wronged her.
REGAN	2	4	1536	1537	2	13	Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.<br>Return you to my sister.
REGAN	2	4	1550	1551	2	16	O, the blest gods! So will you wish on me<br>When the rash mood is on.
REGAN	2	4	1565	1565	1	5	Good sir, to’ th’ purpose.
REGAN	2	4	1568	1570	3	23	I know ’t—my sister’s. This approves her letter,<br>That she would soon be here.<br>Is your lady come?
REGAN	2	4	1593	1598	6	48	I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.<br>If till the expiration of your month<br>You will return and sojourn with my sister,<br>Dismissing half your train, come then to me.<br>I am now from home and out of that provision<br>Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
REGAN	2	4	1625	1630	6	45	Not altogether so.<br>I looked not for you yet, nor am provided<br>For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,<br>For those that mingle reason with your passion<br>Must be content to think you old, and so—<br>But she knows what she does.
REGAN	2	4	1632	1637	6	50	I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?<br>Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br>Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br>Speak ’gainst so great a number? How in one house<br>Should many people under two commands<br>Hold amity? ’Tis hard, almost impossible.
REGAN	2	4	1640	1645	6	43	Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack<br>you,<br>We could control them. If you will come to me<br>(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you<br>To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more<br>Will I give place or notice.
REGAN	2	4	1647	1647	1	7	And in good time you gave it.
REGAN	2	4	1652	1652	1	10	And speak ’t again, my lord. No more with me.
REGAN	2	4	1663	1663	1	3	What need one?
REGAN	2	4	1689	1690	2	14	This house is little. The old man and ’s people<br>Cannot be well bestowed.
REGAN	2	4	1693	1694	2	11	For his particular, I’ll receive him gladly,<br>But not one follower.
REGAN	2	4	1706	1711	6	43	O sir, to willful men<br>The injuries that they themselves procure<br>Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.<br>He is attended with a desperate train,<br>And what they may incense him to, being apt<br>To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
REGAN	3	7	2257	2257	1	3	Hang him instantly.
REGAN	3	7	2285	2285	1	4	Ingrateful fox! ’Tis he.
REGAN	3	7	2291	2291	1	5	Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
REGAN	3	7	2297	2297	1	6	So white, and such a traitor?
REGAN	3	7	2304	2304	1	7	Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.
REGAN	3	7	2307	2308	2	10	To whose hands<br>You have sent the lunatic king. Speak.
REGAN	3	7	2313	2313	1	2	And false.
REGAN	3	7	2316	2317	2	9	Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at<br>peril—
REGAN	3	7	2320	2320	1	3	Wherefore to Dover?
REGAN	3	7	2338	2338	1	8	One side will mock another. Th’ other too.
REGAN	3	7	2345	2345	1	4	How now, you dog?
REGAN	3	7	2350	2350	1	9	Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
REGAN	3	7	2359	2362	4	29	Out, treacherous villain!<br>Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he<br>That made the overture of thy treasons to us,<br>Who is too good to pity thee.
REGAN	3	7	2365	2367	3	27	Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell<br>His way to Dover.<br>How is ’t, my lord? How look you?
REGAN	4	5	2688	2688	1	7	But are my brother’s powers set forth?
REGAN	4	5	2690	2690	1	4	Himself in person there?
REGAN	4	5	2693	2693	1	9	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
REGAN	4	5	2695	2695	1	8	What might import my sister’s letter to him?
REGAN	4	5	2697	2703	7	52	Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.<br>It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,<br>To let him live. Where he arrives he moves<br>All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,<br>In pity of his misery, to dispatch<br>His nighted life; moreover to descry<br>The strength o’ th’ enemy.
REGAN	4	5	2705	2706	2	12	Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us.<br>The ways are dangerous.
REGAN	4	5	2709	2712	4	30	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you<br>Transport her purposes by word? Belike,<br>Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much—<br>Let me unseal the letter.
REGAN	4	5	2714	2717	4	38	I know your lady does not love her husband;<br>I am sure of that; and at her late being here,<br>She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks<br>To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
REGAN	4	5	2719	2729	11	92	I speak in understanding. Y’ are; I know ’t.<br>Therefore I do advise you take this note:<br>My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,<br>And more convenient is he for my hand<br>Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.<br>If you do find him, pray you, give him this,<br>And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br>I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.<br>So, fare you well.<br>If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br>Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
REGAN	4	5	2732	2732	1	3	Fare thee well.
REGAN	5	1	3165	3165	1	6	Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.
REGAN	5	1	3167	3170	4	26	Now, sweet lord,<br>You know the goodness I intend upon you;<br>Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth,<br>Do you not love my sister?
REGAN	5	1	3172	3173	2	12	But have you never found my brother’s way<br>To the forfended place?
REGAN	5	1	3175	3176	2	18	I am doubtful that you have been conjunct<br>And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.
REGAN	5	1	3178	3179	2	13	I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,<br>Be not familiar with her.
REGAN	5	1	3192	3192	1	4	Why is this reasoned?
REGAN	5	1	3199	3199	1	5	Sister, you’ll go with us?
REGAN	5	1	3201	3201	1	7	’Tis most convenient. Pray, go with us.
REGAN	5	3	3321	3326	6	44	That’s as we list to grace him.<br>Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded<br>Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,<br>Bore the commission of my place and person,<br>The which immediacy may well stand up<br>And call itself your brother.
REGAN	5	3	3330	3331	2	10	In my rights,<br>By me invested, he compeers the best.
REGAN	5	3	3333	3333	1	5	Jesters do oft prove prophets.
REGAN	5	3	3336	3342	7	43	Lady, I am not well, else I should answer<br>From a full-flowing stomach.<br>General,<br>Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.<br>Dispose of them, of me; the walls is thine.<br>Witness the world that I create thee here<br>My lord and master.
REGAN	5	3	3347	3347	1	9	Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
REGAN	5	3	3365	3365	1	3	Sick, O, sick!
REGAN	5	3	3378	3378	1	5	My sickness grows upon me.
SECOND_SERVANT	3	7	2372	2373	2	13	I’ll never care what wickedness I do<br>If this man come to good.
SECOND_SERVANT	3	7	2377	2379	3	22	Let’s follow the old earl and get the Bedlam<br>To lead him where he would. His roguish madness<br>Allows itself to anything.
THIRD_SERVANT	3	7	2374	2376	3	19	If she live long<br>And in the end meet the old course of death,<br>Women will all turn monsters.
THIRD_SERVANT	3	7	2380	2381	2	20	Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs<br>To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
