BOTTOM	1	2	259	260	2	14	You were best to call them generally, man by<br>man, according to the scrip.
BOTTOM	1	2	265	267	3	23	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play<br>treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so<br>grow to a point.
BOTTOM	1	2	271	273	3	26	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a<br>merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your<br>actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
BOTTOM	1	2	275	276	2	9	Ready. Name what part I am for, and<br>proceed.
BOTTOM	1	2	278	278	1	8	What is Pyramus—a lover or a tyrant?
BOTTOM	1	2	280	288	17	109	That will ask some tears in the true performing<br>of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their<br>eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some<br>measure. To the rest.—Yet my chief humor is for a<br>tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a<br>cat in, to make all split:<span class="poem" data-words="27">The raging rocks<br>And shivering shocks<br>Shall break the locks<br>Of prison gates.<br>And Phibbus’ car<br>Shall shine from far<br>And make and mar<br>The foolish Fates.</span><br>This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players.<br>This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein. A lover is more<br>condoling.
BOTTOM	1	2	306	307	4	31	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.<br>I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: <span class="quote" data-words="2">Thisne,Thisne!</span>—<span class="quote" data-words="11">Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbedear and lady dear!</span>
BOTTOM	1	2	312	312	1	2	Well, proceed.
BOTTOM	1	2	325	327	4	38	Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will<br>do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that<br>I will make the Duke say <span class="quote" data-words="8">Let him roar again. Lethim roar again!</span>
BOTTOM	1	2	332	332	1	7	That would hang us, every mother’s son.
BOTTOM	1	2	333	337	5	50	I grant you, friends, if you should fright the<br>ladies out of their wits, they would have no more<br>discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my<br>voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking<br>dove. I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.
BOTTOM	1	2	343	344	2	14	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I<br>best to play it in?
BOTTOM	1	2	346	349	4	22	I will discharge it in either your straw-color<br>beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain<br>beard, or your French-crown-color beard,<br>your perfit yellow.
BOTTOM	1	2	360	362	3	17	We will meet, and there we may rehearse<br>most obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be<br>perfit. Adieu.
BOTTOM	1	2	364	364	1	5	Enough. Hold, or cut bowstrings.
BOTTOM	3	1	1001	1006	6	42	Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience<br>well. That same cowardly, giantlike ox-beef<br>hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I<br>promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes<br>water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance,<br>good Master Mustardseed.
BOTTOM	3	1	804	804	1	4	Are we all met?
BOTTOM	3	1	810	810	1	2	Peter Quince?
BOTTOM	3	1	812	815	4	32	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus<br>and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus<br>must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies<br>cannot abide. How answer you that?
BOTTOM	3	1	819	825	7	62	Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.<br>Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to<br>say we will do no harm with our swords, and that<br>Pyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more<br>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not<br>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them<br>out of fear.
BOTTOM	3	1	828	829	2	13	No, make it two more. Let it be written in<br>eight and eight.
BOTTOM	3	1	832	836	5	41	Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,<br>to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a<br>most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful<br>wildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look<br>to ’t.
BOTTOM	3	1	839	843	10	104	Nay, you must name his name, and half his<br>face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he<br>himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the<br>same defect: <span class="quote" data-words="1">Ladies,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="6">Fair ladies, I wouldwish you,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="4">I would request you,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="43">I wouldentreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for<br>yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were<br>pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as<br>other men are.</span> And there indeed let him name his<br>name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
BOTTOM	3	1	855	856	2	14	A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.<br>Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.
BOTTOM	3	1	858	860	3	25	Why, then, may you leave a casement of the<br>great chamber window, where we play, open, and<br>the moon may shine in at the casement.
BOTTOM	3	1	869	873	5	40	Some man or other must present Wall. And<br>let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some<br>roughcast about him to signify wall, or let him<br>hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall<br>Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
BOTTOM	3	1	884	883	1	7	<span class="poem" data-words="7">Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet—</span>
BOTTOM	3	1	886	885	4	29	<span class="poem" data-words="29">…odors savors sweet.<br>So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.—<br>But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,<br>And by and by I will to thee appear.</span>
BOTTOM	3	1	907	906	1	10	<span class="poem" data-words="10">If I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.</span>
BOTTOM	3	1	917	918	2	15	Why do they run away? This is a knavery of<br>them to make me afeard.
BOTTOM	3	1	921	922	2	13	What do you see? You see an ass-head of your<br>own, do you?
BOTTOM	3	1	925	929	9	73	I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of<br>me, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir<br>from this place, do what they can. I will walk up<br>and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear<br>I am not afraid.<span class="song" data-words="22">The ouzel cock, so black of hue,<br>With orange-tawny bill,<br>The throstle with his note so true,<br>The wren with little quill—</span>
BOTTOM	3	1	935	937	7	49	<span class="song" data-words="24">The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,<br>The plainsong cuckoo gray,<br>Whose note full many a man doth mark<br>And dares not answer <span class="quote" data-words="1">nay</span>—</span>for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a<br>bird? Who would give a bird the lie though he cry<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">cuckoo</span> never so?
BOTTOM	3	1	947	952	6	42	Methinks, mistress, you should have little<br>reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason<br>and love keep little company together nowadays.<br>The more the pity that some honest neighbors will<br>not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon<br>occasion.
BOTTOM	3	1	954	956	3	23	Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to get<br>out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own<br>turn.
BOTTOM	3	1	988	989	2	11	I cry your Worships mercy, heartily.—I beseech<br>your Worship’s name.
BOTTOM	3	1	991	993	3	25	I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good<br>Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make<br>bold with you.—Your name, honest gentleman?
BOTTOM	3	1	995	999	5	33	I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash,<br>your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father.<br>Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of<br>more acquaintance, too.—Your name, I beseech<br>you, sir?
BOTTOM	4	1	1509	1509	1	2	Where’s Peaseblossom?
BOTTOM	4	1	1511	1512	2	7	Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s<br>Monsieur Cobweb?
BOTTOM	4	1	1514	1522	9	67	Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you<br>your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped<br>humble-bee on the top of a thistle, and, good<br>monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret<br>yourself too much in the action, monsieur, and,<br>good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break<br>not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a<br>honey-bag, signior.  Where’s Monsieur<br>Mustardseed?
BOTTOM	4	1	1524	1525	2	13	Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.<br>Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.
BOTTOM	4	1	1527	1531	5	42	Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery<br>Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s,<br>monsieur, for methinks I am marvels hairy about<br>the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do<br>but tickle me, I must scratch.
BOTTOM	4	1	1533	1534	2	15	I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s<br>have the tongs and the bones.
BOTTOM	4	1	1536	1539	4	30	Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch<br>your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire<br>to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no<br>fellow.
BOTTOM	4	1	1542	1544	3	31	I had rather have a handful or two of dried<br>peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir<br>me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
BOTTOM	4	1	1714	1733	20	191	 When my cue comes, call me,<br>and I will answer. My next is <span class="quote" data-words="3">Most fair Pyramus.</span><br>Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!<br>Snout the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stolen<br>hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare<br>vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say<br>what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about<br>to expound this dream. Methought I was—there<br>is no man can tell what. Methought I was and<br>methought I had—but man is but a patchedfool if<br>he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of<br>man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,<br>man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to<br>conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream<br>was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this<br>dream. It shall be called Bottom’s Dream because<br>it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the<br>latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,<br>to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her<br>death.
BOTTOM	4	2	1758	1759	2	8	Where are these lads? Where are these<br>hearts?
BOTTOM	4	2	1762	1765	4	31	Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But ask<br>me not what; for, if I tell you, I am not true<br>Athenian. I will tell you everything right as it fell<br>out.
BOTTOM	4	2	1767	1778	12	118	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that<br>the Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,<br>good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your<br>pumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man<br>look o’er his part. For the short and the long is, our<br>play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean<br>linen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his<br>nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws.<br>And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for<br>we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but<br>to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more<br>words. Away! Go, away!
BOTTOM	5	1	1957	1971	15	103	O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!<br>O night, which ever art when day is not!<br>O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!<br>I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot.<br>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,<br>That stand’st between her father’s ground and<br>mine,<br>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,<br>Show me thy chink to blink through with mine<br>eyne.<br>Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for<br>this.<br>But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.<br>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,<br>Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
BOTTOM	5	1	1974	1976	4	40	No, in truth, sir, he should not. <span class="quote" data-words="2">Deceivingme</span> is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now, and I am<br>to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall<br>pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
BOTTOM	5	1	1982	1984	3	20	I see a voice! Now will I to the chink<br>To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.<br>Thisbe?
BOTTOM	5	1	1986	1987	2	16	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace,<br>And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
BOTTOM	5	1	1989	1989	1	7	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
BOTTOM	5	1	1991	1991	1	10	O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
BOTTOM	5	1	1993	1993	1	8	Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
BOTTOM	5	1	2065	2080	16	83	Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.<br>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,<br>For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<br>I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.—<br>But stay! O spite!<br>But mark, poor knight,<br>What dreadful dole is here!<br>Eyes, do you see!<br>How can it be!<br>O dainty duck! O dear!<br>Thy mantle good—<br>What, stained with blood?<br>Approach, ye Furies fell!<br>O Fates, come, come,<br>Cut thread and thrum,<br>Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
BOTTOM	5	1	2084	2100	17	94	O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,<br>Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,<br>Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame<br>That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with<br>cheer?<br>Come, tears, confound!<br>Out, sword, and wound<br>The pap of Pyramus;<br>Ay, that left pap,<br>Where heart doth hop.<br>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<br>Now am I dead;<br>Now am I fled;<br>My soul is in the sky.<br>Tongue, lose thy light!<br>Moon, take thy flight!<br>Now die, die, die, die, die.
BOTTOM	5	1	2146	2149	4	31	No, I assure you, the wall is down that<br>parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the<br>Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between<br>two of our company?
COBWEB	3	1	969	969	1	2	And I.
COBWEB	3	1	972	972	1	4	Where shall we go?
COBWEB	3	1	985	985	1	1	Hail!
COBWEB	3	1	990	990	1	1	Cobweb.
COBWEB	4	1	1513	1513	1	1	Ready.
DEMETRIUS-MND	1	1	93	94	2	13	Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield<br>Thy crazèd title to my certain right.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	559	565	7	55	I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.<br>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<br>The one I’ll stay; the other stayeth me.<br>Thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood,<br>And here am I, and wood within this wood<br>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<br>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	570	572	3	27	Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?<br>Or rather do I not in plainest truth<br>Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	582	583	2	19	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,<br>For I am sick when I do look on thee.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	585	590	6	44	You do impeach your modesty too much<br>To leave the city and commit yourself<br>Into the hands of one that loves you not,<br>To trust the opportunity of night<br>And the ill counsel of a desert place<br>With the rich worth of your virginity.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	598	599	2	19	I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes<br>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	1	606	608	3	26	I will not stay thy questions. Let me go,<br>Or if thou follow me, do not believe<br>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	2	731	731	1	10	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
DEMETRIUS-MND	2	2	733	733	1	8	Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1056	1057	2	17	O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?<br>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1071	1074	4	33	So should the murdered look, and so should I,<br>Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.<br>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,<br>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1077	1077	1	9	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1087	1089	3	25	You spend your passion on a misprised mood.<br>I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood,<br>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1091	1091	1	9	An if I could, what should I get therefor?
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1095	1100	6	49	There is no following her in this fierce vein.<br>Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.<br>So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow<br>For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe,<br>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<br>If for his tender here I make some stay.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1151	1158	8	65	O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!<br>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?<br>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show<br>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<br>That pure congealèd white, high Taurus’ snow,<br>Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow<br>When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss<br>This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1183	1187	5	36	Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.<br>If e’er I loved her, all that love is gone.<br>My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,<br>And now to Helen is it home returned,<br>There to remain.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1189	1191	3	25	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<br>Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.<br>Look where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1265	1265	1	7	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1272	1272	1	10	I say I love thee more than he can do.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1274	1274	1	2	Quick, come.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1277	1280	4	25	No, no. He’ll<br>Seem to break loose. Take on as you<br>would follow,<br>But yet come not. You are a tame man, go!
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1290	1291	2	19	I would I had your bond. For I perceive<br>A weak bond holds you. I’ll not trust your word.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1350	1350	1	10	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1360	1365	6	39	You are too officious<br>In her behalf that scorns your services.<br>Let her alone. Speak not of Helena.<br>Take not her part. For if thou dost intend<br>Never so little show of love to her,<br>Thou shalt aby it.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1369	1369	1	9	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Follow</span>? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1439	1442	4	20	Lysander, speak again.<br>Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?<br>Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy<br>head?
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1449	1449	1	4	Yea, art thou there?
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1460	1463	4	30	Abide me, if thou dar’st, for well I wot<br>Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place,<br>And dar’st not stand nor look me in the face.<br>Where art thou now?
DEMETRIUS-MND	3	2	1465	1470	6	41	Nay, then, thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy this<br>dear<br>If ever I thy face by daylight see.<br>Now go thy way. Faintness constraineth me<br>To measure out my length on this cold bed.<br>By day’s approach look to be visited.
DEMETRIUS-MND	4	1	1671	1687	17	139	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<br>Of this their purpose hither to this wood,<br>And I in fury hither followed them,<br>Fair Helena in fancy following me.<br>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power<br>(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,<br>Melted as the snow, seems to me now<br>As the remembrance of an idle gaud<br>Which in my childhood I did dote upon,<br>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,<br>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,<br>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,<br>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.<br>But like a sickness did I loathe this food.<br>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,<br>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,<br>And will forevermore be true to it.
DEMETRIUS-MND	4	1	1698	1699	2	12	These things seem small and undistinguishable,<br>Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.
DEMETRIUS-MND	4	1	1705	1708	4	30	Are you sure<br>That we are awake? It seems to me<br>That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think<br>The Duke was here and bid us follow him?
DEMETRIUS-MND	4	1	1712	1713	2	17	Why, then, we are awake. Let’s follow him,<br>And by the way let us recount our dreams.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	1940	1941	2	11	No wonder, my lord. One lion may when<br>many asses do.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	1954	1955	2	12	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard<br>discourse, my lord.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	1999	2000	2	13	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so<br>willful to hear without warning.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2021	2022	2	12	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I<br>saw.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2025	2026	2	17	Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carry<br>his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2032	2033	2	9	He should have worn the horns on his<br>head.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2041	2042	2	16	He dares not come there for the candle,<br>for you see, it is already in snuff.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2053	2055	3	20	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,<br>for all these are in the moon. But silence. Here<br>comes Thisbe.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2058	2058	1	3	Well roared, Lion.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2063	2063	1	4	And then came Pyramus.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2101	2102	2	12	No die, but an ace for him, for he is but<br>one.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2113	2115	3	27	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,<br>which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God<br>warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2118	2118	1	5	And thus she means, <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">videlicet</span>—
DEMETRIUS-MND	5	1	2145	2145	1	4	Ay, and Wall too.

EGEUS	1	1	23	46	24	173	Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.—<br>Stand forth, Demetrius.—My noble lord,<br>This man hath my consent to marry her.—<br>Stand forth, Lysander.—And, my gracious duke,<br>This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.—<br>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes<br>And interchanged love tokens with my child.<br>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung<br>With feigning voice verses of feigning love<br>And stol’n the impression of her fantasy<br>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,<br>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers<br>Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.<br>With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart,<br>Turned her obedience (which is due to me)<br>To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke,<br>Be it so she will not here before your Grace<br>Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:<br>As she is mine, I may dispose of her,<br>Which shall be either to this gentleman<br>Or to her death, according to our law<br>Immediately provided in that case.
EGEUS	1	1	97	100	4	31	Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;<br>And what is mine my love shall render him.<br>And she is mine, and all my right of her<br>I do estate unto Demetrius.
EGEUS	4	1	1637	1640	4	26	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,<br>And this Lysander; this Demetrius is,<br>This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena.<br>I wonder of their being here together.
EGEUS	4	1	1646	1646	1	4	It is, my lord.
EGEUS	4	1	1664	1670	7	49	Enough, enough!—My lord, you have enough.<br>I beg the law, the law upon his head.<br>They would have stol’n away.—They would,<br>Demetrius,<br>Thereby to have defeated you and me:<br>You of your wife and me of my consent,<br>Of my consent that she should be your wife.

O happy fair!<br>Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air<br>More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear<br>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br>Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!<br>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.<br>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;<br>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet<br>melody.<br>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>The rest I’d give to be to you translated.<br>O, teach me how you look and with what art<br>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!
HELENA-MND	1	1	199	200	2	10	O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such<br>skill!
HELENA-MND	1	1	202	202	1	8	O, that my prayers could such affection move!
HELENA-MND	1	1	204	204	1	9	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
HELENA-MND	1	1	206	206	1	9	None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!
HELENA-MND	1	1	232	257	26	208	How happy some o’er other some can be!<br>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<br>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.<br>He will not know what all but he do know.<br>And, as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,<br>So I, admiring of his qualities.<br>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,<br>Love can transpose to form and dignity.<br>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;<br>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.<br>Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste.<br>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.<br>And therefore is Love said to be a child<br>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<br>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br>So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.<br>For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,<br>He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;<br>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br>So he dissolved, and show’rs of oaths did melt.<br>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.<br>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night<br>Pursue her. And, for this intelligence<br>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.<br>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br>To have his sight thither and back again.
HELENA-MND	2	1	566	569	4	34	You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!<br>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<br>Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,<br>And I shall have no power to follow you.
HELENA-MND	2	1	573	581	9	78	And even for that do I love you the more.<br>I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,<br>The more you beat me I will fawn on you.<br>Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,<br>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave<br>(Unworthy as I am) to follow you.<br>What worser place can I beg in your love<br>(And yet a place of high respect with me)<br>Than to be usèd as you use your dog?
HELENA-MND	2	1	584	584	1	10	And I am sick when I look not on you.
HELENA-MND	2	1	591	597	7	62	Your virtue is my privilege. For that<br>It is not night when I do see your face,<br>Therefore I think I am not in the night.<br>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<br>For you, in my respect, are all the world.<br>Then, how can it be said I am alone<br>When all the world is here to look on me?
HELENA-MND	2	1	600	605	6	47	The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<br>Run when you will. The story shall be changed:<br>Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;<br>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind<br>Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed<br>When cowardice pursues and valor flies!
HELENA-MND	2	1	609	615	7	63	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,<br>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<br>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.<br>We cannot fight for love as men may do.<br>We should be wooed and were not made to woo.<br>I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell<br>To die upon the hand I love so well.
HELENA-MND	2	2	730	730	1	7	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
HELENA-MND	2	2	732	732	1	9	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.
HELENA-MND	2	2	734	748	15	120	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase.<br>The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br>Happy is Hermia, wheresoe’er she lies,<br>For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.<br>How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears.<br>If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.<br>No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,<br>For beasts that meet me run away for fear.<br>Therefore no marvel though Demetrius<br>Do as a monster fly my presence thus.<br>What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<br>Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?<br>But who is here? Lysander, on the ground!<br>Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.—<br>Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
HELENA-MND	2	2	754	757	4	25	Do not say so. Lysander, say not so.<br>What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what<br>though?<br>Yet Hermia still loves you. Then be content.
HELENA-MND	2	2	770	781	12	95	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<br>When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<br>Is ’t not enough, is ’t not enough, young man,<br>That I did never, no, nor never can<br>Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,<br>But you must flout my insufficiency?<br>Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,<br>In such disdainful manner me to woo.<br>But fare you well. Perforce I must confess<br>I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<br>O, that a lady of one man refused<br>Should of another therefore be abused!
HELENA-MND	3	2	1141	1147	7	53	You do advance your cunning more and more.<br>When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!<br>These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er?<br>Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing<br>weigh.<br>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,<br>Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1149	1149	1	10	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1159	1175	17	140	O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent<br>To set against me for your merriment.<br>If you were civil and knew courtesy,<br>You would not do me thus much injury.<br>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<br>But you must join in souls to mock me too?<br>If you were men, as men you are in show,<br>You would not use a gentle lady so,<br>To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,<br>When, I am sure, you hate me with your hearts.<br>You both are rivals and love Hermia,<br>And now both rivals to mock Helena.<br>A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<br>To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes<br>With your derision! None of noble sort<br>Would so offend a virgin and extort<br>A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1182	1182	1	7	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1208	1235	28	215	Lo, she is one of this confederacy!<br>Now I perceive they have conjoined all three<br>To fashion this false sport in spite of me.—<br>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,<br>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived,<br>To bait me with this foul derision?<br>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<br>The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent<br>When we have chid the hasty-footed time<br>For parting us—O, is all forgot?<br>All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?<br>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br>Have with our needles created both one flower,<br>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds<br>Had been incorporate. So we grew together<br>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br>But yet an union in partition,<br>Two lovely berries molded on one stem;<br>So with two seeming bodies but one heart,<br>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<br>Due but to one, and crownèd with one crest.<br>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,<br>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br>It is not friendly; ’tis not maidenly.<br>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>Though I alone do feel the injury.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1238	1251	14	106	Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,<br>To follow me and praise my eyes and face,<br>And made your other love, Demetrius,<br>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,<br>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,<br>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this<br>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander<br>Deny your love (so rich within his soul)<br>And tender me, forsooth, affection,<br>But by your setting on, by your consent?<br>What though I be not so in grace as you,<br>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,<br>But miserable most, to love unloved?<br>This you should pity rather than despise.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1253	1260	8	63	Ay, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,<br>Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,<br>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.<br>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.<br>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,<br>You would not make me such an argument.<br>But fare you well. ’Tis partly my own fault,<br>Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1263	1263	1	2	O excellent!
HELENA-MND	3	2	1288	1288	1	6	Yes, sooth, and so do you.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1310	1314	5	31	Fine, i’ faith.<br>Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br>No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear<br>Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br>Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
HELENA-MND	3	2	1325	1331	7	54	I pray you, though you mock me,gentlemen,<br>Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;<br>I have no gift at all in shrewishness.<br>I am a right maid for my cowardice.<br>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,<br>Because she is something lower than myself,<br>That I can match her.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1333	1344	12	99	Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.<br>I evermore did love you, Hermia,<br>Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you—<br>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,<br>I told him of your stealth unto this wood.<br>He followed you; for love, I followed him.<br>But he hath chid me hence and threatened me<br>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.<br>And now, so you will let me quiet go,<br>To Athens will I bear my folly back<br>And follow you no further. Let me go.<br>You see how simple and how fond I am.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1346	1346	1	8	A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1348	1348	1	2	With Demetrius.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1351	1353	3	28	O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd.<br>She was a vixen when she went to school,<br>And though she be but little, she is fierce.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1372	1375	4	30	I will not trust you, I,<br>Nor longer stay in your curst company.<br>Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.<br>My legs are longer though, to run away.
HELENA-MND	3	2	1471	1476	6	46	O weary night, O long and tedious night,<br>Abate thy hours! Shine, comforts, from the east,<br>That I may back to Athens by daylight<br>From these that my poor company detest.<br>And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,<br>Steal me awhile from mine own company.
HELENA-MND	4	1	1702	1704	3	16	So methinks.<br>And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,<br>Mine own and not mine own.
HELENA-MND	4	1	1710	1710	1	2	And Hippolyta.
HERMIA	1	1	132	133	2	17	Belike for want of rain, which I could well<br>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
HERMIA	1	1	138	138	1	9	O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.
HERMIA	1	1	140	140	1	9	O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.
HERMIA	1	1	142	142	1	8	O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
HERMIA	1	1	152	157	6	44	If then true lovers have been ever crossed,<br>It stands as an edict in destiny.<br>Then let us teach our trial patience<br>Because it is a customary cross,<br>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<br>Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.
HERMIA	1	1	171	181	11	81	My good Lysander,<br>I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,<br>By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,<br>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br>And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen<br>When the false Trojan under sail was seen,<br>By all the vows that ever men have broke<br>(In number more than ever women spoke),<br>In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
HERMIA	1	1	183	183	1	5	Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?
HERMIA	1	1	198	198	1	9	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HERMIA	1	1	201	201	1	9	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HERMIA	1	1	203	203	1	9	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HERMIA	1	1	205	205	1	8	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HERMIA	1	1	207	212	6	48	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.<br>Lysander and myself will fly this place.<br>Before the time I did Lysander see<br>Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.<br>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell<br>That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
HERMIA	1	1	219	228	10	75	And in the wood where often you and I<br>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,<br>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br>There my Lysander and myself shall meet,<br>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes<br>To seek new friends and stranger companies.<br>Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,<br>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.—<br>Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight<br>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.
HERMIA	1	1	54	54	1	3	So is Lysander.
HERMIA	1	1	58	58	1	9	I would my father looked but with my eyes.
HERMIA	1	1	60	66	7	58	I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.<br>I know not by what power I am made bold,<br>Nor how it may concern my modesty<br>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;<br>But I beseech your Grace that I may know<br>The worst that may befall me in this case<br>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
HERMIA	1	1	81	84	4	31	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<br>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up<br>Unto his lordship whose unwishèd yoke<br>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
HERMIA	2	2	685	686	2	18	Be it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed,<br>For I upon this bank will rest my head.
HERMIA	2	2	689	690	2	17	Nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear,<br>Lie further off yet. Do not lie so near.
HERMIA	2	2	699	707	9	64	Lysander riddles very prettily.<br>Now much beshrew my manners and my pride<br>If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.<br>But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy,<br>Lie further off in human modesty.<br>Such separation, as may well be said,<br>Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.<br>So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.<br>Thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end!
HERMIA	2	2	711	711	1	9	With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed!
HERMIA	2	2	792	803	12	96	Help me, Lysander, help me! Do thy best<br>To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.<br>Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!<br>Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.<br>Methought a serpent ate my heart away,<br>And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.<br>Lysander! What, removed? Lysander, lord!<br>What, out of hearing? Gone? No sound, no word?<br>Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear.<br>Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.—<br>No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.<br>Either death or you I’ll find immediately.
HERMIA	3	2	1058	1070	13	107	Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,<br>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.<br>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,<br>Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep<br>And kill me too.<br>The sun was not so true unto the day<br>As he to me. Would he have stolen away<br>From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon<br>This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon<br>May through the center creep and so displease<br>Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes.<br>It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.<br>So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
HERMIA	3	2	1075	1076	2	16	What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he?<br>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
HERMIA	3	2	1078	1086	9	75	Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds<br>Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?<br>Henceforth be never numbered among men.<br>O, once tell true! Tell true, even for my sake!<br>Durst thou have looked upon him, being awake?<br>And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!<br>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?<br>An adder did it, for with doubler tongue<br>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
HERMIA	3	2	1090	1090	1	10	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
HERMIA	3	2	1092	1094	3	25	A privilege never to see me more.<br>And from thy hated presence part I so.<br>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
HERMIA	3	2	1192	1198	7	55	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,<br>The ear more quick of apprehension makes;<br>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,<br>It pays the hearing double recompense.<br>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;<br>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.<br>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
HERMIA	3	2	1200	1200	1	8	What love could press Lysander from my side?
HERMIA	3	2	1207	1207	1	9	You speak not as you think. It cannot be.
HERMIA	3	2	1236	1237	2	16	I am amazèd at your words.<br>I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.
HERMIA	3	2	1252	1252	1	8	I understand not what you mean by this.
HERMIA	3	2	1264	1264	1	6	Sweet, do not scorn her so.
HERMIA	3	2	1275	1275	1	5	Lysander, whereto tends all this?
HERMIA	3	2	1283	1284	2	12	Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,<br>Sweet love?
HERMIA	3	2	1287	1287	1	4	Do you not jest?
HERMIA	3	2	1294	1301	8	60	What, can you do me greater harm than hate?<br>Hate me? Wherefore? O me, what news, my love?<br>Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?<br>I am as fair now as I was erewhile.<br>Since night you loved me; yet since night you left<br>me.<br>Why, then, you left me—O, the gods forbid!—<br>In earnest, shall I say?
HERMIA	3	2	1307	1309	3	25	O me! You juggler, you cankerblossom,<br>You thief of love! What, have you come by night<br>And stol’n my love’s heart from him?
HERMIA	3	2	1315	1324	10	84	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Puppet</span>? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.<br>Now I perceive that she hath made compare<br>Between our statures; she hath urged her height,<br>And with her personage, her tall personage,<br>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.<br>And are you grown so high in his esteem<br>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<br>How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!<br>How low am I? I am not yet so low<br>But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
HERMIA	3	2	1332	1332	1	3	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Lower</span>? Hark, again!
HERMIA	3	2	1345	1345	1	10	Why, get you gone. Who is ’t that hinders you?
HERMIA	3	2	1347	1347	1	3	What, with Lysander?
HERMIA	3	2	1354	1356	3	21	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Little</span> again? Nothing but <span class="quote" data-words="1">low</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">little</span>?<br>Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?<br>Let me come to her.
HERMIA	3	2	1370	1371	2	15	You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.<br>Nay, go not back.
HERMIA	3	2	1376	1376	1	9	I am amazed and know not what to say.
HERMIA	3	2	1482	1487	6	50	Never so weary, never so in woe,<br>Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,<br>I can no further crawl, no further go.<br>My legs can keep no pace with my desires.<br>Here will I rest me till the break of day.<br>Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!
HERMIA	4	1	1700	1701	2	12	Methinks I see these things with parted eye,<br>When everything seems double.
HERMIA	4	1	1709	1709	1	4	Yea, and my father.
HIPPOLYTA	1	1	7	11	5	35	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;<br>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<br>And then the moon, like to a silver bow<br><span class="" data-words="0">New</span>-bent in heaven, shall behold the night<br>Of our solemnities.
HIPPOLYTA	4	1	1620	1626	7	54	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,<br>When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear<br>With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear<br>Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,<br>The skies, the fountains, every region near<br>Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard<br>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	1779	1779	1	9	’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	1802	1806	5	33	But all the story of the night told over,<br>And all their minds transfigured so together,<br>More witnesseth than fancy’s images<br>And grows to something of great constancy,<br>But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	1869	1870	2	13	I love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,<br>And duty in his service perishing.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	1872	1872	1	9	He says they can do nothing in this kind.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	1907	1909	3	19	Indeed he hath played on this prologue like<br>a child on a recorder—a sound, but not in<br>government.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2001	2001	1	9	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2005	2006	2	9	It must be your imagination, then, and not<br>theirs.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2043	2044	2	10	I am aweary of this moon. Would he would<br>change.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2060	2061	2	11	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shines<br>with a good grace.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2083	2083	1	8	Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2107	2108	2	13	How chance Moonshine is gone before<br>Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
HIPPOLYTA	5	1	2111	2112	2	18	Methinks she should not use a long one for<br>such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.
LYSANDER	1	1	101	112	12	88	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<br>As well possessed. My love is more than his;<br>My fortunes every way as fairly ranked<br>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;<br>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)<br>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.<br>Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br>Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,<br>Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,<br>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
LYSANDER	1	1	130	131	2	19	How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?<br>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
LYSANDER	1	1	134	137	4	32	Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,<br>Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>The course of true love never did run smooth.<br>But either it was different in blood—
LYSANDER	1	1	139	139	1	7	Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—
LYSANDER	1	1	141	141	1	9	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
LYSANDER	1	1	143	151	9	72	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<br>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<br>Making it momentany as a sound,<br>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,<br>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,<br>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<br>And, ere a man hath power to say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Behold!</span><br>The jaws of darkness do devour it up.<br>So quick bright things come to confusion.
LYSANDER	1	1	158	170	13	99	A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:<br>I have a widow aunt, a dowager<br>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.<br>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,<br>And she respects me as her only son.<br>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;<br>And to that place the sharp Athenian law<br>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then<br>Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,<br>And in the wood a league without the town<br>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena<br>To do observance to a morn of May),<br>There will I stay for thee.
LYSANDER	1	1	182	182	1	7	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
LYSANDER	1	1	213	218	6	44	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.<br>Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold<br>Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,<br>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass<br>(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),<br>Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal.
LYSANDER	1	1	229	231	3	16	I will, my Hermia.<br>Helena, adieu.<br>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
LYSANDER	1	1	95	96	2	14	You have her father’s love, Demetrius.<br>Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.
LYSANDER	2	2	681	684	4	35	Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood.<br>And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.<br>We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,<br>And tarry for the comfort of the day.
LYSANDER	2	2	687	688	2	18	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;<br>One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
LYSANDER	2	2	691	698	8	64	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!<br>Love takes the meaning in love’s conference.<br>I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,<br>So that but one heart we can make of it;<br>Two bosoms interchainèd with an oath—<br>So then two bosoms and a single troth.<br>Then by your side no bed-room me deny,<br>For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
LYSANDER	2	2	708	710	3	26	<span class="quote" data-words="2">Amen, amen</span> to that fair prayer, say I,<br>And then end life when I end loyalty!<br>Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!
LYSANDER	2	2	749	753	5	41	And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.<br>Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,<br>That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.<br>Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word<br>Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
LYSANDER	2	2	758	769	12	96	Content with Hermia? No, I do repent<br>The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<br>Not Hermia, but Helena I love.<br>Who will not change a raven for a dove?<br>The will of man is by his reason swayed,<br>And reason says you are the worthier maid.<br>Things growing are not ripe until their season;<br>So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.<br>And touching now the point of human skill,<br>Reason becomes the marshal to my will<br>And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook<br>Love’s stories written in love’s richest book.
LYSANDER	2	2	782	791	10	79	She sees not Hermia.—Hermia, sleep thou there,<br>And never mayst thou come Lysander near.<br>For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br>The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,<br>Or as the heresies that men do leave<br>Are hated most of those they did deceive,<br>So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<br>Of all be hated, but the most of me!<br>And, all my powers, address your love and might<br>To honor Helen and to be her knight.
LYSANDER	3	2	1135	1140	6	52	Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?<br>Scorn and derision never come in tears.<br>Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,<br>In their nativity all truth appears.<br>How can these things in me seem scorn to you,<br>Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?
LYSANDER	3	2	1148	1148	1	9	I had no judgment when to her I swore.
LYSANDER	3	2	1150	1150	1	8	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
LYSANDER	3	2	1176	1181	6	51	You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,<br>For you love Hermia; this you know I know.<br>And here with all goodwill, with all my heart,<br>In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part.<br>And yours of Helena to me bequeath,<br>Whom I do love and will do till my death.
LYSANDER	3	2	1188	1188	1	5	Helen, it is not so.
LYSANDER	3	2	1199	1199	1	10	Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
LYSANDER	3	2	1201	1206	6	44	Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide,<br>Fair Helena, who more engilds the night<br>Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.<br>Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee<br>know<br>The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
LYSANDER	3	2	1261	1262	2	14	Stay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,<br>My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.
LYSANDER	3	2	1266	1271	6	47	Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.<br>Thy threats have no more strength than her weak<br>prayers.—<br>Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do.<br>I swear by that which I will lose for thee,<br>To prove him false that says I love thee not.
LYSANDER	3	2	1273	1273	1	9	If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.
LYSANDER	3	2	1276	1276	1	3	Away, you Ethiop!
LYSANDER	3	2	1281	1282	2	20	Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose,<br>Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
LYSANDER	3	2	1285	1286	2	13	Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!<br>Out, loathèd med’cine! O, hated potion, hence!
LYSANDER	3	2	1289	1289	1	8	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
LYSANDER	3	2	1292	1293	2	19	What? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<br>Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.
LYSANDER	3	2	1302	1306	5	36	Ay, by my life,<br>And never did desire to see thee more.<br>Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.<br>Be certain, nothing truer, ’tis no jest<br>That I do hate thee and love Helena.
LYSANDER	3	2	1349	1349	1	9	Be not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena.
LYSANDER	3	2	1357	1359	3	15	Get you gone, you dwarf,<br>You minimus of hind’ring knotgrass made,<br>You bead, you acorn—
LYSANDER	3	2	1366	1368	3	22	Now she holds me not.<br>Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,<br>Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
LYSANDER	3	2	1434	1434	1	8	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.
LYSANDER	3	2	1436	1436	1	6	I will be with thee straight.
LYSANDER	3	2	1451	1458	8	68	He goes before me and still dares me on.<br>When I come where he calls, then he is gone.<br>The villain is much lighter-heeled than I.<br>I followed fast, but faster he did fly,<br>That fallen am I in dark uneven way,<br>And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day,<br>For if but once thou show me thy gray light,<br>I’ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
LYSANDER	4	1	1650	1650	1	3	Pardon, my lord.
LYSANDER	4	1	1656	1663	8	64	My lord, I shall reply amazèdly,<br>Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,<br>I cannot truly say how I came here.<br>But, as I think—for truly would I speak,<br>And now I do bethink me, so it is:<br>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent<br>Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,<br>Without the peril of the Athenian law—
LYSANDER	4	1	1711	1711	1	9	And he did bid us follow to the temple.
LYSANDER	5	1	1810	1811	2	13	More than to us<br>Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
LYSANDER	5	1	1904	1906	3	29	He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;<br>he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is<br>not enough to speak, but to speak true.
LYSANDER	5	1	2023	2023	1	9	This lion is a very fox for his valor.
LYSANDER	5	1	2048	2048	1	2	Proceed, Moon.
LYSANDER	5	1	2064	2064	1	5	And so the lion vanished.
LYSANDER	5	1	2103	2104	2	12	Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he is<br>nothing.
LYSANDER	5	1	2116	2117	2	9	She hath spied him already with those<br>sweet eyes.
MOTE	3	1	970	970	1	2	And I.
MOTE	3	1	972	972	1	4	Where shall we go?
MOTE	3	1	986	986	1	1	Hail!
MUSTARDSEED	3	1	1000	1000	1	1	Mustardseed.
MUSTARDSEED	3	1	971	971	1	2	And I.
MUSTARDSEED	3	1	972	972	1	4	Where shall we go?
MUSTARDSEED	3	1	987	987	1	1	Hail!
MUSTARDSEED	4	1	1523	1523	1	1	Ready.
MUSTARDSEED	4	1	1526	1526	1	3	What’s your will?
OBERON	2	1	426	426	1	6	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
OBERON	2	1	429	429	1	8	Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?
OBERON	2	1	440	447	8	47	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,<br>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<br>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<br>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering<br>night<br>From Perigouna, whom he ravishèd,<br>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,<br>With Ariadne and Antiopa?
OBERON	2	1	485	488	4	27	Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.<br>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br>I do but beg a little changeling boy<br>To be my henchman.
OBERON	2	1	507	507	1	8	How long within this wood intend you stay?
OBERON	2	1	512	512	1	10	Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
OBERON	2	1	515	523	9	67	Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove<br>Till I torment thee for this injury.—<br>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest<br>Since once I sat upon a promontory<br>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back<br>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br>That the rude sea grew civil at her song<br>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres<br>To hear the sea-maid’s music.
OBERON	2	1	525	544	20	154	That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),<br>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br>Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took<br>At a fair vestal thronèd by the west,<br>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow<br>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.<br>But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft<br>Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon,<br>And the imperial vot’ress passèd on<br>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br>Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.<br>It fell upon a little western flower,<br>Before, milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,<br>And maidens call it <span class="quote" data-words="1">love-in-idleness.</span><br>Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.<br>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid<br>Will make or man or woman madly dote<br>Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again<br>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
OBERON	2	1	547	558	12	93	Having once this juice,<br>I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep<br>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.<br>The next thing then she, waking, looks upon<br>(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,<br>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)<br>She shall pursue it with the soul of love.<br>And ere I take this charm from off her sight<br>(As I can take it with another herb),<br>I’ll make her render up her page to me.<br>But who comes here? I am invisible,<br>And I will overhear their conference.
OBERON	2	1	616	618	3	29	Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,<br>Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.<br>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
OBERON	2	1	620	639	20	170	I pray thee give it me.<br>I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br>Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br>Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine,<br>With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine.<br>There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br>Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.<br>And there the snake throws her enameled skin,<br>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.<br>And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes<br>And make her full of hateful fantasies.<br>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.<br>A sweet Athenian lady is in love<br>With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes,<br>But do it when the next thing he espies<br>May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man<br>By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br>Effect it with some care, that he may prove<br>More fond on her than she upon her love.<br>And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
OBERON	2	2	673	672	8	53	<span class="poem" data-words="53">What thou seest when thou dost wake,<br>Do it for thy true love take.<br>Love and languish for his sake.<br>Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,<br>Pard, or boar with bristled hair,<br>In thy eye that shall appear<br>When thou wak’st, it is thy dear.<br>Wake when some vile thing is near.</span>
OBERON	3	2	1012	1016	5	41	I wonder if Titania be awaked;<br>Then what it was that next came in her eye,<br>Which she must dote on in extremity.<br>Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?<br>What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
OBERON	3	2	1048	1050	3	26	This falls out better than I could devise.<br>But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes<br>With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?
OBERON	3	2	1054	1054	1	7	Stand close. This is the same Athenian.
OBERON	3	2	1101	1104	4	32	What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite<br>And laid the love juice on some true-love’s sight.<br>Of thy misprision must perforce ensue<br>Some true-love turned, and not a false turned true.
OBERON	3	2	1107	1112	6	49	About the wood go swifter than the wind,<br>And Helena of Athens look thou find.<br>All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer<br>With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.<br>By some illusion see thou bring her here.<br>I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.
OBERON	3	2	1115	1114	8	44	<span class="poem" data-words="44">Flower of this purple dye,<br>Hit with Cupid’s archery,<br>Sink in apple of his eye.<br>When his love he doth espy,<br>Let her shine as gloriously<br>As the Venus of the sky.—<br>When thou wak’st, if she be by,<br>Beg of her for remedy.</span>
OBERON	3	2	1129	1128	2	11	<span class="poem" data-words="11">Stand aside. The noise they make<br>Will cause Demetrius to awake.</span>
OBERON	3	2	1377	1378	2	13	This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak’st,<br>Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully.
OBERON	3	2	1386	1409	24	186	Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.<br>Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night;<br>The starry welkin cover thou anon<br>With drooping fog as black as Acheron,<br>And lead these testy rivals so astray<br>As one come not within another’s way.<br>Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue;<br>Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong.<br>And sometime rail thou like Demetrius.<br>And from each other look thou lead them thus,<br>Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep<br>With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.<br>Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye,<br>Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,<br>To take from thence all error with his might<br>And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.<br>When they next wake, all this derision<br>Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision.<br>And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,<br>With league whose date till death shall never end.<br>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<br>I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;<br>And then I will her charmèd eye release<br>From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.
OBERON	3	2	1421	1428	8	60	But we are spirits of another sort.<br>I with the Morning’s love have oft made sport<br>And, like a forester, the groves may tread<br>Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,<br>Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams,<br>Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.<br>But notwithstanding, haste!

OBERON	4	1	1551	1576	30	238	Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?<br>Her dotage now I do begin to pity.<br>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,<br>Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,<br>I did upbraid her and fall out with her.<br>For she his hairy temples then had rounded<br>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;<br>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<br>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<br>Stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes,<br>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.<br>When I had at my pleasure taunted her,<br>And she in mild terms begged my patience,<br>I then did ask of her her changeling child,<br>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<br>To bear him to my bower in Fairyland.<br>And now I have the boy, I will undo<br>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.<br>And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp<br>From off the head of this Athenian swain,<br>That he, awaking when the other do,<br>May all to Athens back again repair<br>And think no more of this night’s accidents<br>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.<br>But first I will release the Fairy Queen.<span class="poem" data-words="25">Be as thou wast wont to be.<br>See as thou wast wont to see.<br>Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower<br>Hath such force and blessèd power.</span><br>Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.
OBERON	4	1	1583	1583	1	4	There lies your love.
OBERON	4	1	1586	1588	3	23	Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.—<br>Titania, music call; and strike more dead<br>Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
OBERON	4	1	1592	1600	9	62	Sound music.<br>Come, my queen, take hands with me,<br>And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.<br>Now thou and I are new in amity,<br>And will tomorrow midnight solemnly<br>Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,<br>And bless it to all fair prosperity.<br>There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be<br>Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

PEASEBLOSSOM	4	1	1510	1510	1	1	Ready.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1820	1820	1	3	Here, mighty Theseus.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1824	1825	2	18	There is a brief how many sports are ripe.<br>Make choice of which your Highness will see first.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1843	1852	10	84	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long<br>(Which is as brief as I have known a play),<br>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,<br>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play,<br>There is not one word apt, one player fitted.<br>And tragical, my noble lord, it is.<br>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself,<br>Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,<br>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears<br>The passion of loud laughter never shed.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1854	1857	4	29	Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,<br>Which never labored in their minds till now,<br>And now have toiled their unbreathed memories<br>With this same play, against your nuptial.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1859	1864	6	41	No, my noble lord,<br>It is not for you. I have heard it over,<br>And it is nothing, nothing in the world,<br>Unless you can find sport in their intents,<br>Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain<br>To do you service.
PHILOSTRATE	5	1	1890	1890	1	8	So please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.
QUINCE	1	2	258	258	1	5	Is all our company here?
QUINCE	1	2	261	264	4	32	Here is the scroll of every man’s name which<br>is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our<br>interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his<br>wedding day at night.
QUINCE	1	2	268	268	3	16	Marry, our play is The most lamentablecomedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and<br>Thisbe.
QUINCE	1	2	274	274	1	9	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
QUINCE	1	2	277	277	1	8	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
QUINCE	1	2	279	279	1	9	A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.
QUINCE	1	2	297	297	1	4	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
QUINCE	1	2	299	299	1	7	Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
QUINCE	1	2	301	301	1	8	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
QUINCE	1	2	304	305	2	19	That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and<br>you may speak as small as you will.
QUINCE	1	2	310	311	2	10	No, no, you must play Pyramus—and, Flute,<br>you Thisbe.
QUINCE	1	2	313	313	1	4	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
QUINCE	1	2	315	316	2	11	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s<br>mother.—Tom Snout, the tinker.
QUINCE	1	2	318	320	3	21	You, Pyramus’ father.—Myself, Thisbe’s<br>father.—Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part.—<br>And I hope here is a play fitted.
QUINCE	1	2	323	324	2	11	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but<br>roaring.
QUINCE	1	2	329	331	3	27	An you should do it too terribly, you would<br>fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would<br>shriek, and that were enough to hang us all.
QUINCE	1	2	332	332	1	7	That would hang us, every mother’s son.
QUINCE	1	2	338	342	5	35	You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus<br>is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one<br>shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely gentlemanlike<br>man. Therefore you must needs play <br>Pyramus.
QUINCE	1	2	345	345	1	4	Why, what you will.
QUINCE	1	2	350	359	10	99	Some of your French crowns have no hair at<br>all, and then you will play barefaced. But, masters,<br>here are your parts, and I am<br>to entreat you, request you, and desire you to con<br>them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace<br>wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There<br>will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall<br>be dogged with company and our devices known. In<br>the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as<br>our play wants. I pray you fail me not.
QUINCE	1	2	363	363	1	6	At the Duke’s Oak we meet.
QUINCE	3	1	805	809	5	38	Pat, pat. And here’s a marvels convenient<br>place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be<br>our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house,<br>and we will do it in action as we will do it before<br>the Duke.
QUINCE	3	1	811	811	1	5	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
QUINCE	3	1	826	827	2	16	Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall<br>be written in eight and six.
QUINCE	3	1	849	852	4	29	Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard<br>things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,<br>for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by<br>moonlight.
QUINCE	3	1	857	857	1	6	Yes, it doth shine that night.
QUINCE	3	1	861	866	6	57	Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of<br>thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure<br>or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there<br>is another thing: we must have a wall in the great<br>chamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,<br>did talk through the chink of a wall.
QUINCE	3	1	874	878	5	38	If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,<br>every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,<br>you begin. When you have spoken your<br>speech, enter into that brake, and so everyone<br>according to his cue.
QUINCE	3	1	883	883	1	5	Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.
QUINCE	3	1	885	885	1	2	Odors, odors!
QUINCE	3	1	892	894	3	23	Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand<br>he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to<br>come again.
QUINCE	3	1	900	903	4	35	<span class="quote" data-words="2">Ninus’ tomb,</span> man! Why, you must not<br>speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You<br>speak all your part at once, cues and all.—Pyramus,<br>enter. Your cue is past. It is <span class="quote" data-words="2">never tire.</span>
QUINCE	3	1	908	909	2	12	O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray,<br>masters, fly, masters! Help!
QUINCE	3	1	923	924	2	8	Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art<br>translated!
QUINCE	4	2	1734	1735	2	11	Have you sent to Bottom’s house? Is he come<br>home yet?
QUINCE	4	2	1740	1741	2	18	It is not possible. You have not a man in all<br>Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
QUINCE	4	2	1744	1745	2	16	Yea, and the best person too, and he is a very<br>paramour for a sweet voice.
QUINCE	4	2	1760	1761	2	9	Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy<br>hour!
QUINCE	4	2	1766	1766	1	5	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
QUINCE	5	1	1892	1902	11	86	If we offend, it is with our goodwill.<br>That you should think we come not to offend,<br>But with goodwill. To show our simple skill,<br>That is the true beginning of our end.<br>Consider, then, we come but in despite.<br>We do not come, as minding to content you,<br>Our true intent is. All for your delight<br>We are not here. That you should here repent<br>you,<br>The actors are at hand, and, by their show,<br>You shall know all that you are like to know.
QUINCE	5	1	1912	1938	27	195	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.<br>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<br>This man is Pyramus, if you would know.<br>This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.<br>This man with lime and roughcast doth present<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Wall,</span> that vile wall which did these lovers<br>sunder;<br>And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are<br>content<br>To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.<br>This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,<br>Presenteth <span class="quote" data-words="1">Moonshine,</span> for, if you will know,<br>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<br>To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.<br>This grisly beast (which <span class="quote" data-words="1">Lion</span> hight by name)<br>The trusty Thisbe coming first by night<br>Did scare away, or rather did affright;<br>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,<br>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<br>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,<br>And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain.<br>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<br>He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.<br>And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,<br>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain<br>At large discourse, while here they do remain.
ROBIN	2	1	365	365	1	6	How now, spirit? Whither wander you?
ROBIN	2	1	382	396	15	113	The King doth keep his revels here tonight.<br>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,<br>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath<br>Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;<br>She never had so sweet a changeling.<br>And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.<br>But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,<br>Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her<br>joy.<br>And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>But they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
ROBIN	2	1	408	424	17	128	Thou speakest aright.<br>I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br>I jest to Oberon and make him smile<br>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.<br>And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl<br>In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br>And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob<br>And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.<br>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br>And <span class="quote" data-words="1">Tailor!</span> cries, and falls into a cough,<br>And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe<br>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear<br>A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br>But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.
ROBIN	2	1	524	524	1	2	I remember.
ROBIN	2	1	545	546	2	11	I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth<br>In forty minutes.
ROBIN	2	1	619	619	1	4	Ay, there it is.
ROBIN	2	1	640	640	1	9	Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so.

ROBIN	3	2	1051	1053	3	25	I took him sleeping—that is finished, too—<br>And the Athenian woman by his side,<br>That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.

STARVELING	1	2	332	332	1	7	That would hang us, every mother’s son.
STARVELING	3	1	817	818	2	12	I believe we must leave the killing out,<br>when all is done.
STARVELING	3	1	831	831	1	6	I fear it, I promise you.
STARVELING	4	2	1736	1737	2	11	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he<br>is transported.
STARVELING	5	1	2031	2031	1	7	This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.
STARVELING	5	1	2036	2037	2	17	This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.<br>Myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be.
STARVELING	5	1	2049	2052	4	31	 All that I have to say is to tell<br>you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i’ th’<br>moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog<br>my dog.
THESEUS	1	1	1	6	6	43	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<br>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in<br>Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow<br>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires<br>Like to a stepdame or a dowager<br>Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
THESEUS	1	1	113	128	16	119	I must confess that I have heard so much,<br>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<br>But, being overfull of self-affairs,<br>My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,<br>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.<br>I have some private schooling for you both.—<br>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<br>To fit your fancies to your father’s will,<br>Or else the law of Athens yields you up<br>(Which by no means we may extenuate)<br>To death or to a vow of single life.—<br>Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?—<br>Demetrius and Egeus, go along.<br>I must employ you in some business<br>Against our nuptial, and confer with you<br>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
THESEUS	1	1	12	20	9	61	Go, Philostrate,<br>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.<br>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.<br>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<br>The pale companion is not for our pomp.<br>Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword<br>And won thy love doing thee injuries,<br>But I will wed thee in another key,<br>With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.
THESEUS	1	1	22	22	1	8	Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
THESEUS	1	1	47	53	7	54	What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.<br>To you, your father should be as a god,<br>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one<br>To whom you are but as a form in wax<br>By him imprinted, and within his power<br>To leave the figure or disfigure it.<br>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
THESEUS	1	1	55	57	3	19	In himself he is,<br>But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,<br>The other must be held the worthier.
THESEUS	1	1	59	59	1	8	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
THESEUS	1	1	67	80	14	102	Either to die the death, or to abjure<br>Forever the society of men.<br>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,<br>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br>Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)<br>You can endure the livery of a nun,<br>For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,<br>To live a barren sister all your life,<br>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<br>Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood<br>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,<br>But earthlier happy is the rose distilled<br>Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,<br>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.
THESEUS	1	1	85	92	8	56	Take time to pause, and by the next new moon<br>(The sealing day betwixt my love and me<br>For everlasting bond of fellowship),<br>Upon that day either prepare to die<br>For disobedience to your father’s will,<br>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,<br>Or on Diana’s altar to protest<br>For aye austerity and single life.
THESEUS	4	1	1611	1619	9	70	Go, one of you, find out the Forester.<br>For now our observation is performed,<br>And, since we have the vaward of the day,<br>My love shall hear the music of my hounds.<br>Uncouple in the western valley; let them go.<br>Dispatch, I say, and find the Forester.<br>We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top<br>And mark the musical confusion<br>Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
THESEUS	4	1	1627	1636	10	73	My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,<br>So flewed, so sanded; and their heads are hung<br>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;<br>Crook-kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls;<br>Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,<br>Each under each. A cry more tunable<br>Was never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,<br>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.<br>Judge when you hear.—But soft! What nymphs are<br>these?
THESEUS	4	1	1641	1645	5	39	No doubt they rose up early to observe<br>The rite of May, and hearing our intent,<br>Came here in grace of our solemnity.<br>But speak, Egeus. Is not this the day<br>That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
THESEUS	4	1	1647	1647	1	9	Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
THESEUS	4	1	1648	1649	2	14	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.<br>Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?
THESEUS	4	1	1651	1655	5	38	I pray you all, stand up.<br>I know you two are rival enemies.<br>How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br>That hatred is so far from jealousy<br>To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?
THESEUS	4	1	1688	1697	10	67	Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.<br>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.—<br>Egeus, I will overbear your will,<br>For in the temple by and by, with us,<br>These couples shall eternally be knit.—<br>And, for the morning now is something worn,<br>Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.<br>Away with us to Athens. Three and three,<br>We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.<br>Come, Hippolyta.
THESEUS	5	1	1780	1801	22	152	More strange than true. I never may believe<br>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.<br>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,<br>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend<br>More than cool reason ever comprehends.<br>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet<br>Are of imagination all compact.<br>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold:<br>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,<br>Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.<br>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br>Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to<br>heaven,<br>And as imagination bodies forth<br>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen<br>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing<br>A local habitation and a name.<br>Such tricks hath strong imagination<br>That, if it would but apprehend some joy,<br>It comprehends some bringer of that joy.<br>Or in the night, imagining some fear,<br>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
THESEUS	5	1	1807	1809	3	21	Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth.—<br>Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love<br>Accompany your hearts!
THESEUS	5	1	1812	1819	8	49	Come now, what masques, what dances shall we<br>have<br>To wear away this long age of three hours<br>Between our after-supper and bedtime?<br>Where is our usual manager of mirth?<br>What revels are in hand? Is there no play<br>To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?<br>Call Philostrate.
THESEUS	5	1	1821	1823	3	24	Say what abridgment have you for this evening,<br>What masque, what music? How shall we beguile<br>The lazy time if not with some delight?
THESEUS	5	1	1826	1838	17	124	The battle with the Centaurs, to be sungBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.<br>We’ll none of that. That have I told my love<br>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.<br>The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.<br>That is an old device, and it was played<br>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.<br>The thrice-three Muses mourning for the deathOf learning, late deceased in beggary.<br>That is some satire, keen and critical,<br>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.<br>A tedious brief scene of young PyramusAnd his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Merry</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">tragical</span>? <span class="quote" data-words="1">Tedious</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">brief</span>?<br>That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow!<br>How shall we find the concord of this discord?
THESEUS	5	1	1853	1853	1	7	What are they that do play it?
THESEUS	5	1	1858	1858	1	5	And we will hear it.
THESEUS	5	1	1865	1868	4	26	I will hear that play,<br>For never anything can be amiss<br>When simpleness and duty tender it.<br>Go, bring them in—and take your places, ladies.
THESEUS	5	1	1871	1871	1	9	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
THESEUS	5	1	1873	1889	17	128	The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.<br>Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;<br>And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect<br>Takes it in might, not merit.<br>Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd<br>To greet me with premeditated welcomes,<br>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,<br>Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br>Throttle their practiced accent in their fears,<br>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,<br>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,<br>Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome,<br>And in the modesty of fearful duty,<br>I read as much as from the rattling tongue<br>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity<br>In least speak most, to my capacity.
THESEUS	5	1	1891	1891	1	3	Let him approach.
THESEUS	5	1	1903	1903	1	7	This fellow doth not stand upon points.
THESEUS	5	1	1910	1911	2	15	His speech was like a tangled chain—nothing<br>impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
THESEUS	5	1	1939	1939	1	8	I wonder if the lion be to speak.
THESEUS	5	1	1952	1953	2	9	Would you desire lime and hair to speak<br>better?
THESEUS	5	1	1956	1956	1	6	Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence.
THESEUS	5	1	1972	1973	2	8	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should<br>curse again.
THESEUS	5	1	1997	1998	2	9	Now is the wall down between the two<br>neighbors.
THESEUS	5	1	2002	2004	3	18	The best in this kind are but shadows, and<br>the worst are no worse, if imagination amend<br>them.
THESEUS	5	1	2007	2009	3	28	If we imagine no worse of them than they of<br>themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here<br>come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
THESEUS	5	1	2019	2020	2	9	A very gentle beast, and of a good<br>conscience.
THESEUS	5	1	2024	2024	1	7	True, and a goose for his discretion.
THESEUS	5	1	2027	2030	4	31	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his<br>valor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.<br>Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the<br>Moon.
THESEUS	5	1	2034	2035	2	12	He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible<br>within the circumference.
THESEUS	5	1	2038	2040	3	26	This is the greatest error of all the rest; the<br>man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else<br><span class="quote" data-words="5">the man i’ th’ moon</span>?
THESEUS	5	1	2045	2047	3	26	It appears by his small light of discretion that<br>he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason,<br>we must stay the time.
THESEUS	5	1	2059	2059	1	3	Well run, Thisbe.
THESEUS	5	1	2062	2062	1	3	Well moused, Lion.
THESEUS	5	1	2081	2082	2	18	This passion, and the death of a dear friend,<br>would go near to make a man look sad.
THESEUS	5	1	2105	2106	2	15	With the help of a surgeon he might yet<br>recover and yet prove an ass.
THESEUS	5	1	2109	2110	2	18	She will find him by starlight.<br>Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.
THESEUS	5	1	2143	2144	2	9	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the<br>dead.
THESEUS	5	1	2150	2165	16	130	No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needs<br>no excuse. Never excuse. For when the players are<br>all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if<br>he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged<br>himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine<br>tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.<br>But, come, your Bergomask. Let your<br>epilogue alone.<br>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.<br>Lovers, to bed! ’Tis almost fairy time.<br>I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn<br>As much as we this night have overwatched.<br>This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled<br>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.<br>A fortnight hold we this solemnity<br>In nightly revels and new jollity.
TITANIA	2	1	427	428	2	13	What, jealous Oberon? Fairies skip hence.<br>I have forsworn his bed and company.
TITANIA	2	1	430	439	10	75	Then I must be thy lady. But I know<br>When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland<br>And in the shape of Corin sat all day<br>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love<br>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<br>Come from the farthest steep of India,<br>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<br>Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,<br>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come<br>To give their bed joy and prosperity?
TITANIA	2	1	448	484	37	275	These are the forgeries of jealousy;<br>And never, since the middle summer’s spring,<br>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,<br>By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook,<br>Or in the beachèd margent of the sea,<br>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br>But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.<br>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br>As in revenge have sucked up from the sea<br>Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land,<br>Hath every pelting river made so proud<br>That they have overborne their continents.<br>The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,<br>The plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br>Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.<br>The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,<br>And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.<br>The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud,<br>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,<br>For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.<br>The human mortals want their winter here.<br>No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.<br>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br>That rheumatic diseases do abound.<br>And thorough this distemperature we see<br>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,<br>And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown<br>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br>Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,<br>The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br>Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world<br>By their increase now knows not which is which.<br>And this same progeny of evils comes<br>From our debate, from our dissension;<br>We are their parents and original.
TITANIA	2	1	489	506	18	135	Set your heart at rest:<br>The Fairyland buys not the child of me.<br>His mother was a vot’ress of my order,<br>And in the spicèd Indian air by night<br>Full often hath she gossiped by my side<br>And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,<br>Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,<br>When we have laughed to see the sails conceive<br>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,<br>Following (her womb then rich with my young<br>squire),<br>Would imitate and sail upon the land<br>To fetch me trifles and return again,<br>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,<br>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br>And for her sake I will not part with him.
TITANIA	2	1	508	511	4	32	Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.<br>If you will patiently dance in our round<br>And see our moonlight revels, go with us.<br>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
TITANIA	2	1	513	514	2	15	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.<br>We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
TITANIA	2	2	641	648	8	67	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;<br>Then, for the third part of a minute, hence—<br>Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds,<br>Some war with reremice for their leathern wings<br>To make my small elves coats, and some keep back<br>The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders<br>At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep.<br>Then to your offices and let me rest.
TITANIA	3	1	1007	1011	5	37	Come, wait upon him. Lead him to my bower.<br>The moon, methinks, looks with a wat’ry eye,<br>And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,<br>Lamenting some enforcèd chastity.<br>Tie up my lover’s tongue. Bring him silently.
TITANIA	3	1	934	934	1	8	What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed?
TITANIA	3	1	942	946	5	43	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.<br>Mine ear is much enamored of thy note,<br>So is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape,<br>And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me<br>On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
TITANIA	3	1	953	953	1	8	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
TITANIA	3	1	957	967	11	90	Out of this wood do not desire to go.<br>Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.<br>I am a spirit of no common rate.<br>The summer still doth tend upon my state,<br>And I do love thee. Therefore go with me.<br>I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,<br>And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep<br>And sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep.<br>And I will purge thy mortal grossness so<br>That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.—<br>Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Mote, and Mustardseed!
TITANIA	3	1	973	983	11	82	Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.<br>Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;<br>Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,<br>With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;<br>The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,<br>And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs<br>And light them at the fiery glowworms’ eyes<br>To have my love to bed and to arise;<br>And pluck the wings from painted butterflies<br>To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.<br>Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
TITANIA	4	1	1505	1508	4	32	Come, sit thee down upon this flow’ry bed,<br>While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,<br>And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head,<br>And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
TITANIA	4	1	1532	1532	1	9	What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
TITANIA	4	1	1535	1535	1	9	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
TITANIA	4	1	1540	1541	2	16	I have a venturous fairy that shall seek<br>The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.
TITANIA	4	1	1545	1550	6	49	Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.—<br>Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.<br>So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle<br>Gently entwist; the female ivy so<br>Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.<br>O, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!
TITANIA	4	1	1581	1582	2	14	My Oberon, what visions have I seen!<br>Methought I was enamored of an ass.
TITANIA	4	1	1584	1585	2	15	How came these things to pass?<br>O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
TITANIA	4	1	1589	1589	1	7	Music, ho, music such as charmeth sleep!
TITANIA	4	1	1607	1606	4	26	<span class="poem" data-words="26">Come, my lord, and in our flight<br>Tell me how it came this night<br>That I sleeping here was found<br>With these mortals on the ground.</span>
TITANIA	5	1	2192	2191	4	25	<span class="poem" data-words="25">First rehearse your song by rote,<br>To each word a warbling note.<br>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,<br>Will we sing and bless this place.</span>
