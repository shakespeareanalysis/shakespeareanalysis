Then he offered<br>it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my<br>thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.<br>And then he offered it the third time. He put it the<br>third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement<br>hooted and clapped their chopped hands and<br>threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a<br>deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the<br>crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he<br>swooned and fell down at it.

	1	2	354	366	13	128	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived<br>the common herd was glad he refused the crown,<br>he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his<br>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,<br>if I would not have taken him at a word, I<br>would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so<br>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he<br>had done or said anything amiss, he desired their<br>Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four<br>wenches where I stood cried <span class="quote" data-words="3">Alas, good soul!</span> and<br>forgave him with all their hearts.

ANTONY	1	2	281	281	1	1	Caesar.
ANTONY	1	2	286	287	2	15	Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous.<br>He is a noble Roman, and well given.
ANTONY	1	2	87	87	1	3	Caesar, my lord.
ANTONY	1	2	92	93	2	11	I shall remember.<br>When Caesar says <span class="quote" data-words="2">Do this,</span> it is performed.
ANTONY	2	2	1071	1071	1	5	So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY	3	1	1291	1305	15	115	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.<br>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,<br>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:<br>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;<br>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.<br>Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him;<br>Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.<br>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<br>May safely come to him and be resolved<br>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<br>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<br>So well as Brutus living, but will follow<br>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus<br>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state<br>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
ANTONY	3	1	1311	1311	1	4	I’ll fetch him presently.
ANTONY	3	1	1317	1332	16	136	O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?<br>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils<br>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.—<br>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.<br>If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br>As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument<br>Of half that worth as those your swords made rich<br>With the most noble blood of all this world.<br>I do beseech you, if you bear me hard,<br>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br>Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<br>I shall not find myself so apt to die;<br>No place will please me so, no mean of death,<br>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br>The choice and master spirits of this age.
ANTONY	3	1	1353	1383	31	222	I doubt not of your wisdom.<br>Let each man render me his bloody hand.<br>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.—<br>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.—<br>Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours,<br>Metellus;—<br>Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;—<br>Though last, not least in love, yours, good<br>Trebonius.—<br>Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?<br>My credit now stands on such slippery ground<br>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br>Either a coward or a flatterer.—<br>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true!<br>If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death<br>To see thy Antony making his peace,<br>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes—<br>Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse?<br>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br>It would become me better than to close<br>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<br>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave<br>hart,<br>Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand<br>Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe.<br>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,<br>And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.<br>How like a deer strucken by many princes<br>Dost thou here lie!
ANTONY	3	1	1385	1387	3	19	Pardon me, Caius Cassius.<br>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;<br>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
ANTONY	3	1	1392	1396	5	42	Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed<br>Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.<br>Friends am I with you all and love you all,<br>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons<br>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
ANTONY	3	1	1401	1405	5	32	That’s all I seek;<br>And am, moreover, suitor that I may<br>Produce his body to the marketplace,<br>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,<br>Speak in the order of his funeral.
ANTONY	3	1	1430	1431	2	8	Be it so.<br>I do desire no more.
ANTONY	3	1	1433	1455	23	183	O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<br>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.<br>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man<br>That ever livèd in the tide of times.<br>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy<br>(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips<br>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)<br>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<br>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<br>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<br>Blood and destruction shall be so in use<br>And dreadful objects so familiar<br>That mothers shall but smile when they behold<br>Their infants quartered with the hands of war,<br>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds;<br>And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,<br>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,<br>Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice<br>Cry <span class="quote" data-words="1">Havoc!</span> and let slip the dogs of war,<br>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br>With carrion men groaning for burial.<br>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
ANTONY	3	1	1457	1457	1	9	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY	3	1	1461	1464	4	32	Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep.<br>Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,<br>Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,<br>Began to water. Is thy master coming?
ANTONY	3	1	1466	1477	12	84	Post back with speed and tell him what hath<br>chanced.<br>Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,<br>No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.<br>Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile;<br>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse<br>Into the marketplace. There shall I try,<br>In my oration, how the people take<br>The cruel issue of these bloody men,<br>According to the which thou shalt discourse<br>To young Octavius of the state of things.<br>Lend me your hand.
ANTONY	3	2	1548	1548	1	8	For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY	3	2	1557	1557	1	3	You gentle Romans—
ANTONY	3	2	1559	1594	36	268	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.<br>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>The evil that men do lives after them;<br>The good is oft interrèd with their bones.<br>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.<br>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>And grievously hath Caesar answered it.<br>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest<br>(For Brutus is an honorable man;<br>So are they all, all honorable men),<br>Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.<br>He was my friend, faithful and just to me,<br>But Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.<br>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;<br>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.<br>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>And sure he is an honorable man.<br>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>You all did love him once, not without cause.<br>What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for<br>him?—<br>O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me;<br>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>And I must pause till it come back to me.
ANTONY	3	2	1607	1626	20	155	But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,<br>And none so poor to do him reverence.<br>O masters, if I were disposed to stir<br>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br>I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,<br>Who, you all know, are honorable men.<br>I will not do them wrong. I rather choose<br>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br>Than I will wrong such honorable men.<br>But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.<br>I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will.<br>Let but the commons hear this testament,<br>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,<br>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds<br>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood—<br>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory<br>And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br>Unto their issue.
ANTONY	3	2	1629	1635	7	66	Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it.<br>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.<br>And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,<br>It will inflame you; it will make you mad.<br>’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,<br>For if you should, O, what would come of it?
ANTONY	3	2	1638	1641	4	33	Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?<br>I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.<br>I fear I wrong the honorable men<br>Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.
ANTONY	3	2	1646	1649	4	37	You will compel me, then, to read the will?<br>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<br>And let me show you him that made the will.<br>Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
ANTONY	3	2	1656	1656	1	9	Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off.
ANTONY	3	2	1658	1686	29	233	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br>You all do know this mantle. I remember<br>The first time ever Caesar put it on.<br>’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,<br>That day he overcame the Nervii.<br>Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.<br>See what a rent the envious Casca made.<br>Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed,<br>And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away,<br>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,<br>As rushing out of doors to be resolved<br>If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;<br>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.<br>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br>This was the most unkindest cut of all.<br>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,<br>Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,<br>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br>Even at the base of Pompey’s statue<br>(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.<br>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br>Then I and you and all of us fell down,<br>Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.<br>O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel<br>The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.<br>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<br>Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br>Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors.
ANTONY	3	2	1695	1695	1	2	Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY	3	2	1699	1720	22	183	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br>They that have done this deed are honorable.<br>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br>That made them do it. They are wise and honorable<br>And will no doubt with reasons answer you.<br>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.<br>I am no orator, as Brutus is,<br>But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man<br>That love my friend, and that they know full well<br>That gave me public leave to speak of him.<br>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech<br>To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.<br>I tell you that which you yourselves do know,<br>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb<br>mouths,<br>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,<br>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<br>In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
ANTONY	3	2	1724	1724	1	8	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY	3	2	1726	1729	4	35	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.<br>Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<br>Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.<br>You have forgot the will I told you of.
ANTONY	3	2	1731	1733	3	20	Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal:<br>To every Roman citizen he gives,<br>To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
ANTONY	3	2	1736	1736	1	4	Hear me with patience.
ANTONY	3	2	1738	1743	6	44	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<br>His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,<br>On this side Tiber. He hath left them you,<br>And to your heirs forever—common pleasures<br>To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.<br>Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?
ANTONY	3	2	1752	1754	3	19	Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot;<br>Take thou what course thou wilt.<br>How now, fellow?
ANTONY	3	2	1756	1756	1	3	Where is he?
ANTONY	3	2	1758	1760	3	24	And thither will I straight to visit him.<br>He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry<br>And in this mood will give us anything.
ANTONY	3	2	1763	1764	2	17	Belike they had some notice of the people<br>How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
ANTONY	4	1	1805	1806	2	9	These many, then, shall die; their names are<br>pricked.
ANTONY	4	1	1812	1815	4	34	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.<br>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house;<br>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine<br>How to cut off some charge in legacies.
ANTONY	4	1	1818	1821	4	29	This is a slight, unmeritable man,<br>Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,<br>The threefold world divided, he should stand<br>One of the three to share it?
ANTONY	4	1	1825	1834	10	81	Octavius, I have seen more days than you,<br>And, though we lay these honors on this man<br>To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads,<br>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,<br>To groan and sweat under the business,<br>Either led or driven, as we point the way;<br>And having brought our treasure where we will,<br>Then take we down his load and turn him off<br>(Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears<br>And graze in commons.
ANTONY	4	1	1837	1855	19	139	So is my horse, Octavius, and for that<br>I do appoint him store of provender.<br>It is a creature that I teach to fight,<br>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,<br>His corporal motion governed by my spirit;<br>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so.<br>He must be taught and trained and bid go forth—<br>A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds<br>On objects, arts, and imitations<br>Which, out of use and staled by other men,<br>Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him<br>But as a property. And now, Octavius,<br>Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius<br>Are levying powers. We must straight make head.<br>Therefore let our alliance be combined,<br>Our best friends made, our means stretched;<br>And let us presently go sit in council<br>How covert matters may be best disclosed<br>And open perils surest answerèd.
ANTONY	5	1	2279	2284	6	44	Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know<br>Wherefore they do it. They could be content<br>To visit other places, and come down<br>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face<br>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.<br>But ’tis not so.
ANTONY	5	1	2289	2290	2	14	Octavius, lead your battle softly on<br>Upon the left hand of the even field.
ANTONY	5	1	2292	2292	1	8	Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONY	5	1	2297	2298	2	16	No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.<br>Make forth. The Generals would have some words.
ANTONY	5	1	2303	2305	3	22	In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.<br>Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,<br>Crying <span class="quote" data-words="4">Long live, hail, Caesar!</span>
ANTONY	5	1	2310	2310	1	3	Not stingless too.
ANTONY	5	1	2314	2320	7	49	Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers<br>Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.<br>You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like<br>hounds<br>And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet,<br>Whilst damnèd Casca, like a cur, behind<br>Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
ANTONY	5	1	2339	2339	1	3	Old Cassius still.
ANTONY	5	4	2557	2557	1	3	Where is he?
ANTONY	5	4	2564	2570	7	54	This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you,<br>A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe.<br>Give him all kindness. I had rather have<br>Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,<br>And see whe’er Brutus be alive or dead,<br>And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent<br>How everything is chanced.
ANTONY	5	5	2644	2651	8	65	This was the noblest Roman of them all.<br>All the conspirators save only he<br>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.<br>He only in a general honest thought<br>And common good to all made one of them.<br>His life was gentle and the elements<br>So mixed in him that nature might stand up<br>And say to all the world <span class="quote" data-words="4">This was a man.</span>
ANTONYS_SERVANT	3	1	1291	1305	15	115	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.<br>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,<br>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:<br>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;<br>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.<br>Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him;<br>Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.<br>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<br>May safely come to him and be resolved<br>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<br>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<br>So well as Brutus living, but will follow<br>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus<br>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state<br>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
ANTONYS_SERVANT	3	1	1311	1311	1	4	I’ll fetch him presently.
ARTEMIDORUS	2	3	1084	1089	16	117	<span class="letter" data-words="70">Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heed of<br>Cassius, come not near Casca, have an eye to Cinna,<br>trust not Trebonius, mark well Metellus Cimber.<br>Decius Brutus loves thee not. Thou hast wronged<br>Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these<br>men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not<br>immortal, look about you. Security gives way to<br>conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!<span class="letter" data-words="2">Thy lover,</span><span class="letter" data-words="1">Artemidorus</span></span>Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,<br>And as a suitor will I give him this.<br>My heart laments that virtue cannot live<br>Out of the teeth of emulation.<br>If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;<br>If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
ARTEMIDORUS	3	1	1156	1156	1	5	Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule.
ARTEMIDORUS	3	1	1159	1160	2	17	O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit<br>That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.
ARTEMIDORUS	3	1	1162	1162	1	6	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
BRUTUS	1	2	103	103	1	9	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
BRUTUS	1	2	111	111	1	2	Not I.
BRUTUS	1	2	113	116	4	27	I am not gamesome. I do lack some part<br>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.<br>I’ll leave you.
BRUTUS	1	2	122	133	12	81	Cassius,<br>Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,<br>I turn the trouble of my countenance<br>Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am<br>Of late with passions of some difference,<br>Conceptions only proper to myself,<br>Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.<br>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved<br>(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)<br>Nor construe any further my neglect<br>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br>Forgets the shows of love to other men.
BRUTUS	1	2	138	139	2	15	No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself<br>But by reflection, by some other things.
BRUTUS	1	2	149	151	3	23	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<br>That you would have me seek into myself<br>For that which is not in me?
BRUTUS	1	2	165	166	2	14	What means this shouting? I do fear the people<br>Choose Caesar for their king.
BRUTUS	1	2	169	176	8	71	I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.<br>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<br>What is it that you would impart to me?<br>If it be aught toward the general good,<br>Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other<br>And I will look on both indifferently;<br>For let the gods so speed me as I love<br>The name of honor more than I fear death.
BRUTUS	1	2	219	221	3	19	Another general shout!<br>I do believe that these applauses are<br>For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
BRUTUS	1	2	251	264	14	115	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.<br>What you would work me to, I have some aim.<br>How I have thought of this, and of these times,<br>I shall recount hereafter. For this present,<br>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<br>Be any further moved. What you have said<br>I will consider; what you have to say<br>I will with patience hear, and find a time<br>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<br>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<br>Brutus had rather be a villager<br>Than to repute himself a son of Rome<br>Under these hard conditions as this time<br>Is like to lay upon us.
BRUTUS	1	2	268	268	1	8	The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
BRUTUS	1	2	272	278	7	54	I will do so. But look you, Cassius,<br>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,<br>And all the rest look like a chidden train.<br>Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero<br>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes<br>As we have seen him in the Capitol,<br>Being crossed in conference by some senators.
BRUTUS	1	2	307	308	2	13	Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today<br>That Caesar looks so sad.
BRUTUS	1	2	310	310	1	9	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
BRUTUS	1	2	314	314	1	6	What was the second noise for?
BRUTUS	1	2	318	318	1	6	Was the crown offered him thrice?
BRUTUS	1	2	324	324	1	8	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
BRUTUS	1	2	345	345	1	8	’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.
BRUTUS	1	2	353	353	1	8	What said he when he came unto himself?
BRUTUS	1	2	367	367	1	8	And, after that, he came thus sad away?
BRUTUS	1	2	387	388	2	18	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!<br>He was quick mettle when he went to school.
BRUTUS	1	2	395	398	4	39	And so it is. For this time I will leave you.<br>Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,<br>I will come home to you; or, if you will,<br>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
BRUTUS	2	1	584	588	5	38	What, Lucius, ho!—<br>I cannot by the progress of the stars<br>Give guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!—<br>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.—<br>When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
BRUTUS	2	1	590	591	2	17	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.<br>When it is lighted, come and call me here.
BRUTUS	2	1	593	619	27	206	It must be by his death. And for my part<br>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,<br>But for the general. He would be crowned:<br>How that might change his nature, there’s the<br>question.<br>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,<br>And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,<br>And then I grant we put a sting in him<br>That at his will he may do danger with.<br>Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins<br>Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,<br>I have not known when his affections swayed<br>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof<br>That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,<br>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<br>But, when he once attains the upmost round,<br>He then unto the ladder turns his back,<br>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<br>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.<br>Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel<br>Will bear no color for the thing he is,<br>Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,<br>Would run to these and these extremities.<br>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,<br>Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow<br>mischievous,<br>And kill him in the shell.
BRUTUS	2	1	624	625	2	17	Get you to bed again. It is not day.<br>Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
BRUTUS	2	1	627	627	1	8	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
BRUTUS	2	1	629	642	16	116	The exhalations, whizzing in the air,<br>Give so much light that I may read by them.<span class="letter" data-words="13">Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself!<br>Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!</span><br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.</span><br>Such instigations have been often dropped<br>Where I have took them up.<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">Shall Rome, etc.</span> Thus must I piece it out:<br>Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What,<br>Rome?<br>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome<br>The Tarquin drive when he was called a king.<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">Speak, strike, redress!</span> Am I entreated<br>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,<br>If the redress will follow, thou receivest<br>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.
BRUTUS	2	1	646	655	10	71	’Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.<br>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,<br>I have not slept.<br>Between the acting of a dreadful thing<br>And the first motion, all the interim is<br>Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.<br>The genius and the mortal instruments<br>Are then in council, and the state of man,<br>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then<br>The nature of an insurrection.
BRUTUS	2	1	658	658	1	3	Is he alone?
BRUTUS	2	1	660	661	2	4	Do you know<br>them?
BRUTUS	2	1	666	676	11	70	Let ’em enter.<br>They are the faction. O conspiracy,<br>Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night,<br>When evils are most free? O, then, by day<br>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough<br>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,<br>conspiracy.<br>Hide it in smiles and affability;<br>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,<br>Not Erebus itself were dim enough<br>To hide thee from prevention.
BRUTUS	2	1	679	680	2	18	I have been up this hour, awake all night.<br>Know I these men that come along with you?
BRUTUS	2	1	686	686	1	4	He is welcome hither.
BRUTUS	2	1	688	688	1	4	He is welcome too.
BRUTUS	2	1	690	692	3	15	They are all welcome.<br>What watchful cares do interpose themselves<br>Betwixt your eyes and night?
BRUTUS	2	1	706	706	1	9	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
BRUTUS	2	1	708	734	27	210	No, not an oath. If not the face of men,<br>The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—<br>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,<br>And every man hence to his idle bed.<br>So let high-sighted tyranny range on<br>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these—<br>As I am sure they do—bear fire enough<br>To kindle cowards and to steel with valor<br>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,<br>What need we any spur but our own cause<br>To prick us to redress? What other bond<br>Than secret Romans that have spoke the word<br>And will not palter? And what other oath<br>Than honesty to honesty engaged<br>That this shall be or we will fall for it?<br>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,<br>Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls<br>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain<br>The even virtue of our enterprise,<br>Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br>To think that or our cause or our performance<br>Did need an oath, when every drop of blood<br>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,<br>Is guilty of a several bastardy<br>If he do break the smallest particle<br>Of any promise that hath passed from him.
BRUTUS	2	1	745	747	3	20	O, name him not! Let us not break with him,<br>For he will never follow anything<br>That other men begin.
BRUTUS	2	1	758	779	22	176	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,<br>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,<br>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;<br>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.<br>Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,<br>And in the spirit of men there is no blood.<br>O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit<br>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,<br>Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,<br>Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.<br>Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.<br>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<br>Stir up their servants to an act of rage<br>And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make<br>Our purpose necessary and not envious;<br>Which so appearing to the common eyes,<br>We shall be called purgers, not murderers.<br>And for Mark Antony, think not of him,<br>For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm<br>When Caesar’s head is off.
BRUTUS	2	1	782	786	5	43	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.<br>If he love Caesar, all that he can do<br>Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.<br>And that were much he should, for he is given<br>To sports, to wildness, and much company.
BRUTUS	2	1	789	789	1	4	Peace, count the clock.
BRUTUS	2	1	813	813	1	8	By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?
BRUTUS	2	1	818	820	3	25	Now, good Metellus, go along by him.<br>He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.<br>Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.
BRUTUS	2	1	826	835	10	75	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.<br>Let not our looks put on our purposes,<br>But bear it, as our Roman actors do,<br>With untired spirits and formal constancy.<br>And so good morrow to you every one.<br>Boy! Lucius!—Fast asleep? It is no matter.<br>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.<br>Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies<br>Which busy care draws in the brains of men.<br>Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.
BRUTUS	2	1	837	839	3	25	Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?<br>It is not for your health thus to commit<br>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
BRUTUS	2	1	860	860	1	10	I am not well in health, and that is all.
BRUTUS	2	1	863	863	1	9	Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
BRUTUS	2	1	883	883	1	4	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
BRUTUS	2	1	894	896	3	21	You are my true and honorable wife,<br>As dear to me as are the ruddy drops<br>That visit my sad heart.
BRUTUS	2	1	909	917	9	58	O you gods,<br>Render me worthy of this noble wife!<br>Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,<br>And by and by thy bosom shall partake<br>The secrets of my heart.<br>All my engagements I will construe to thee,<br>All the charactery of my sad brows.<br>Leave me with haste.<br>Lucius, who ’s that knocks?
BRUTUS	2	1	919	921	3	14	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.—<br>Boy, stand aside.<br>Caius Ligarius, how?
BRUTUS	2	1	923	924	2	19	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,<br>To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
BRUTUS	2	1	927	928	2	17	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,<br>Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
BRUTUS	2	1	937	937	1	10	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
BRUTUS	2	1	939	941	3	24	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,<br>I shall unfold to thee as we are going<br>To whom it must be done.
BRUTUS	2	1	946	946	1	3	Follow me then.
BRUTUS	2	2	1067	1067	1	4	Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.
BRUTUS	2	2	1082	1083	2	17	That every like is not the same, O Caesar,<br>The heart of Brutus earns to think upon.
BRUTUS	3	1	1170	1170	1	4	What said Popilius Lena?
BRUTUS	3	1	1173	1173	1	8	Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.
BRUTUS	3	1	1178	1180	3	19	Cassius, be constant.<br>Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,<br>For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
BRUTUS	3	1	1185	1185	1	8	He is addressed. Press near and second him.
BRUTUS	3	1	1210	1212	3	21	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,<br>Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may<br>Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
BRUTUS	3	1	1243	1244	2	14	People and Senators, be not affrighted.<br>Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid.
BRUTUS	3	1	1247	1247	1	2	Where’s Publius?
BRUTUS	3	1	1251	1253	3	24	Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer.<br>There is no harm intended to your person,<br>Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.
BRUTUS	3	1	1256	1257	2	13	Do so, and let no man abide this deed<br>But we the doers.
BRUTUS	3	1	1262	1265	4	24	Fates, we will know your<br>pleasures.<br>That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time,<br>And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
BRUTUS	3	1	1268	1275	8	64	Grant that, and then is death a benefit.<br>So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged<br>His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,<br>And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood<br>Up to the elbows and besmear our swords.<br>Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,<br>And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads,<br>Let’s all cry <span class="quote" data-words="4">Peace, freedom, and liberty!</span>
BRUTUS	3	1	1280	1282	3	20	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<br>That now on Pompey’s basis lies along<br>No worthier than the dust!
BRUTUS	3	1	1290	1290	1	8	Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.
BRUTUS	3	1	1306	1310	5	32	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.<br>I never thought him worse.<br>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,<br>He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,<br>Depart untouched.
BRUTUS	3	1	1312	1312	1	10	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
BRUTUS	3	1	1316	1316	1	7	But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony!
BRUTUS	3	1	1333	1345	13	109	O Antony, beg not your death of us!<br>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br>As by our hands and this our present act<br>You see we do, yet see you but our hands<br>And this the bleeding business they have done.<br>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<br>And pity to the general wrong of Rome<br>(As fire drives out fire, so pity pity)<br>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<br>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.<br>Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts<br>Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in<br>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
BRUTUS	3	1	1348	1352	5	34	Only be patient till we have appeased<br>The multitude, beside themselves with fear;<br>And then we will deliver you the cause<br>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<br>Have thus proceeded.
BRUTUS	3	1	1397	1400	4	27	Or else were this a savage spectacle.<br>Our reasons are so full of good regard<br>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,<br>You should be satisfied.
BRUTUS	3	1	1406	1406	1	4	You shall, Mark Antony.
BRUTUS	3	1	1413	1420	8	54	By your pardon,<br>I will myself into the pulpit first<br>And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.<br>What Antony shall speak I will protest<br>He speaks by leave and by permission,<br>And that we are contented Caesar shall<br>Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.<br>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
BRUTUS	3	1	1422	1429	8	62	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.<br>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us<br>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar<br>And say you do ’t by our permission,<br>Else shall you not have any hand at all<br>About his funeral. And you shall speak<br>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,<br>After my speech is ended.
BRUTUS	3	1	1432	1432	1	7	Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
BRUTUS	3	2	1479	1485	7	46	Then follow me and give me audience, friends.—<br>Cassius, go you into the other street<br>And part the numbers.—<br>Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;<br>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;<br>And public reasons shall be renderèd<br>Of Caesar’s death.
BRUTUS	3	2	1490	1513	24	233	Be patient till the last.<br>Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my<br>cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me<br>for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor<br>that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom,<br>and awake your senses that you may the better<br>judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear<br>friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love<br>to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend<br>demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my<br>answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved<br>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and<br>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all<br>freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he<br>was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I<br>honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.<br>There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor<br>for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is<br>here so base that would be a bondman? If any,<br>speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude<br>that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him<br>have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not<br>love his country? If any, speak, for him have I<br>offended. I pause for a reply.
BRUTUS	3	2	1515	1526	12	121	Then none have I offended. I have done no<br>more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The<br>question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his<br>glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor<br>his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.<br>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,<br>who, though he had no hand in his death, shall<br>receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the<br>commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With<br>this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the<br>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself<br>when it shall please my country to need my death.
BRUTUS	3	2	1535	1535	1	2	My countrymen—
BRUTUS	3	2	1538	1544	7	52	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,<br>And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.<br>Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech<br>Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony<br>(By our permission) is allowed to make.<br>I do entreat you, not a man depart,<br>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
BRUTUS	4	2	1860	1860	1	2	Stand ho!
BRUTUS	4	2	1862	1862	1	6	What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
BRUTUS	4	2	1865	1869	5	36	He greets me well.—Your master, Pindarus,<br>In his own change or by ill officers,<br>Hath given me some worthy cause to wish<br>Things done undone, but if he be at hand<br>I shall be satisfied.
BRUTUS	4	2	1873	1875	3	20	He is not doubted.<br>A word, Lucilius,<br>How he received you. Let me be resolved.
BRUTUS	4	2	1880	1889	10	74	Thou hast described<br>A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,<br>When love begins to sicken and decay<br>It useth an enforcèd ceremony.<br>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;<br>But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,<br>Make gallant show and promise of their mettle,<br>But when they should endure the bloody spur,<br>They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades,<br>Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
BRUTUS	4	2	1893	1894	2	10	Hark, he is arrived.<br>March gently on to meet him.
BRUTUS	4	2	1896	1896	1	6	Stand ho! Speak the word along.
BRUTUS	4	2	1901	1902	2	18	Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?<br>And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
BRUTUS	4	2	1905	1911	7	50	Cassius, be content.<br>Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well.<br>Before the eyes of both our armies here<br>(Which should perceive nothing but love from us),<br>Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away.<br>Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,<br>And I will give you audience.
BRUTUS	4	2	1915	1917	3	26	Lucius, do you the like, and let no man<br>Come to our tent till we have done our conference.<br>Let Lucilius and Titinius guard our door.
BRUTUS	4	3	1923	1923	1	9	You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
BRUTUS	4	3	1926	1929	4	25	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself<br>Are much condemned to have an itching palm,<br>To sell and mart your offices for gold<br>To undeservers.
BRUTUS	4	3	1933	1934	2	14	The name of Cassius honors this corruption,<br>And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
BRUTUS	4	3	1936	1946	11	86	Remember March; the ides of March remember.<br>Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?<br>What villain touched his body that did stab<br>And not for justice? What, shall one of us<br>That struck the foremost man of all this world<br>But for supporting robbers, shall we now<br>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes<br>And sell the mighty space of our large honors<br>For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?<br>I had rather be a dog and bay the moon<br>Than such a Roman.
BRUTUS	4	3	1952	1952	1	6	Go to! You are not, Cassius.
BRUTUS	4	3	1954	1954	1	5	I say you are not.
BRUTUS	4	3	1957	1957	1	3	Away, slight man!
BRUTUS	4	3	1959	1961	3	24	Hear me, for I will speak.<br>Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<br>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
BRUTUS	4	3	1963	1971	9	74	All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.<br>Go show your slaves how choleric you are<br>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<br>Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch<br>Under your testy humor? By the gods,<br>You shall digest the venom of your spleen<br>Though it do split you. For, from this day forth,<br>I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<br>When you are waspish.
BRUTUS	4	3	1973	1976	4	34	You say you are a better soldier.<br>Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,<br>And it shall please me well. For mine own part,<br>I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
BRUTUS	4	3	1980	1980	1	6	If you did, I care not.
BRUTUS	4	3	1983	1983	1	9	Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
BRUTUS	4	3	1985	1985	1	1	No.
BRUTUS	4	3	1987	1988	2	6	For your life you durst<br>not.
BRUTUS	4	3	1991	2008	18	142	You have done that you should be sorry for.<br>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>For I am armed so strong in honesty<br>That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>Which I respect not. I did send to you<br>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,<br>For I can raise no money by vile means.<br>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart<br>And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring<br>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br>By any indirection. I did send<br>To you for gold to pay my legions,<br>Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?<br>Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?<br>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous<br>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<br>Dash him to pieces!
BRUTUS	4	3	2010	2010	1	2	You did.
BRUTUS	4	3	2015	2015	1	9	I do not, till you practice them on me.
BRUTUS	4	3	2017	2017	1	6	I do not like your faults.
BRUTUS	4	3	2019	2020	2	13	A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear<br>As huge as high Olympus.
BRUTUS	4	3	2037	2044	8	48	Sheathe your<br>dagger.<br>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.<br>Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.<br>O Cassius, you are yokèd with a lamb<br>That carries anger as the flint bears fire,<br>Who, much enforcèd, shows a hasty spark<br>And straight is cold again.
BRUTUS	4	3	2048	2048	1	8	When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
BRUTUS	4	3	2050	2050	1	4	And my heart too.
BRUTUS	4	3	2052	2052	1	3	What’s the matter?
BRUTUS	4	3	2056	2059	4	21	Yes, Cassius, and from<br>henceforth<br>When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br>He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
BRUTUS	4	3	2070	2070	1	7	Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence!
BRUTUS	4	3	2072	2074	3	20	I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.<br>What should the wars do with these jigging fools?—<br>Companion, hence!
BRUTUS	4	3	2076	2077	2	12	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders<br>Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
BRUTUS	4	3	2080	2080	1	5	Lucius, a bowl of wine.
BRUTUS	4	3	2082	2082	1	8	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
BRUTUS	4	3	2085	2085	1	8	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
BRUTUS	4	3	2087	2087	1	3	She is dead.
BRUTUS	4	3	2091	2096	6	35	Impatient of my absence,<br>And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony<br>Have made themselves so strong—for with her<br>death<br>That tidings came—with this she fell distract<br>And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
BRUTUS	4	3	2098	2098	1	2	Even so.
BRUTUS	4	3	2100	2101	2	18	Speak no more of her.—Give me a bowl of wine.—<br>In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
BRUTUS	4	3	2105	2107	3	20	Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.<br>Now sit we close about this taper here,<br>And call in question our necessities.
BRUTUS	4	3	2109	2113	5	30	No more, I pray you.—<br>Messala, I have here receivèd letters<br>That young Octavius and Mark Antony<br>Come down upon us with a mighty power,<br>Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
BRUTUS	4	3	2115	2115	1	3	With what addition?
BRUTUS	4	3	2119	2121	3	20	Therein our letters do not well agree.<br>Mine speak of seventy senators that died<br>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
BRUTUS	4	3	2126	2126	1	2	No, Messala.
BRUTUS	4	3	2128	2128	1	2	Nothing, Messala.
BRUTUS	4	3	2130	2130	1	10	Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
BRUTUS	4	3	2132	2132	1	9	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
BRUTUS	4	3	2135	2137	3	22	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.<br>With meditating that she must die once,<br>I have the patience to endure it now.
BRUTUS	4	3	2141	2142	2	14	Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br>Of marching to Philippi presently?
BRUTUS	4	3	2144	2144	1	2	Your reason?
BRUTUS	4	3	2150	2159	10	70	Good reasons must of force give place to better.<br>The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground<br>Do stand but in a forced affection,<br>For they have grudged us contribution.<br>The enemy, marching along by them,<br>By them shall make a fuller number up,<br>Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged,<br>From which advantage shall we cut him off<br>If at Philippi we do face him there,<br>These people at our back.
BRUTUS	4	3	2161	2172	12	92	Under your pardon. You must note besides<br>That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<br>Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe.<br>The enemy increaseth every day;<br>We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br>There is a tide in the affairs of men<br>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br>Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br>On such a full sea are we now afloat,<br>And we must take the current when it serves<br>Or lose our ventures.
BRUTUS	4	3	2175	2178	4	28	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br>And nature must obey necessity,<br>Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br>There is no more to say.
BRUTUS	4	3	2181	2185	5	21	Lucius.<br>My gown.<br>Farewell, good Messala.—<br>Good night, Titinius.—Noble, noble Cassius,<br>Good night and good repose.
BRUTUS	4	3	2190	2190	1	3	Everything is well.
BRUTUS	4	3	2192	2192	1	4	Good night, good brother.
BRUTUS	4	3	2194	2195	2	16	Farewell, everyone.<br>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
BRUTUS	4	3	2197	2200	4	30	What, thou speak’st drowsily?<br>Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o’erwatched.<br>Call Claudius and some other of my men;<br>I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
BRUTUS	4	3	2203	2205	3	26	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.<br>It may be I shall raise you by and by<br>On business to my brother Cassius.
BRUTUS	4	3	2208	2211	4	39	I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.<br>It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.<br>Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so.<br>I put it in the pocket of my gown.
BRUTUS	4	3	2213	2215	3	25	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.<br>Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile<br>And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
BRUTUS	4	3	2217	2218	2	13	It does, my boy.<br>I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
BRUTUS	4	3	2220	2221	2	19	I should not urge thy duty past thy might.<br>I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
BRUTUS	4	3	2223	2241	19	172	It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.<br>I will not hold thee long. If I do live,<br>I will be good to thee.<br>This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber,<br>Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,<br>That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night.<br>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.<br>If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument.<br>I’ll take it from thee and, good boy, good night.<br>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down<br>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.<br>How ill this taper burns.<br>Ha, who comes here?—<br>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br>That shapes this monstrous apparition.<br>It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?<br>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,<br>That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?<br>Speak to me what thou art.
BRUTUS	4	3	2243	2243	1	3	Why com’st thou?
BRUTUS	4	3	2245	2245	1	7	Well, then I shall see thee again?
BRUTUS	4	3	2247	2251	5	33	Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.<br>Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.<br>Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.—<br>Boy, Lucius!—Varro, Claudius, sirs, awake!<br>Claudius!
BRUTUS	4	3	2253	2254	2	10	He thinks he still is at his instrument.<br>Lucius, awake!
BRUTUS	4	3	2256	2256	1	9	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
BRUTUS	4	3	2258	2258	1	8	Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
BRUTUS	4	3	2260	2261	2	10	Sleep again, Lucius.—Sirrah Claudius!<br>Fellow thou, awake!
BRUTUS	4	3	2264	2264	1	10	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
BRUTUS	4	3	2266	2266	1	4	Ay. Saw you anything?
BRUTUS	4	3	2269	2271	3	20	Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.<br>Bid him set on his powers betimes before,<br>And we will follow.
BRUTUS	5	1	2294	2294	1	6	They stand and would have parley.
BRUTUS	5	1	2300	2300	1	7	Words before blows; is it so, countrymen?
BRUTUS	5	1	2302	2302	1	8	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
BRUTUS	5	1	2311	2313	3	19	O yes, and soundless too,<br>For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,<br>And very wisely threat before you sting.
BRUTUS	5	1	2331	2332	2	14	Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands<br>Unless thou bring’st them with thee.
BRUTUS	5	1	2335	2336	2	17	O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,<br>Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
BRUTUS	5	1	2346	2346	1	7	Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you.
BRUTUS	5	1	2373	2373	1	3	Even so, Lucilius.
BRUTUS	5	1	2382	2389	8	62	Even by the rule of that philosophy<br>By which I did blame Cato for the death<br>Which he did give himself (I know not how,<br>But I do find it cowardly and vile,<br>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent<br>The time of life), arming myself with patience<br>To stay the providence of some high powers<br>That govern us below.
BRUTUS	5	1	2393	2401	9	72	No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,<br>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.<br>He bears too great a mind. But this same day<br>Must end that work the ides of March begun.<br>And whether we shall meet again, I know not.<br>Therefore our everlasting farewell take.<br>Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.<br>If we do meet again, why we shall smile;<br>If not, why then this parting was well made.
BRUTUS	5	1	2405	2408	4	36	Why then, lead on.—O, that a man might know<br>The end of this day’s business ere it come!<br>But it sufficeth that the day will end,<br>And then the end is known.—Come ho, away!
BRUTUS	5	2	2409	2414	6	51	Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills<br>Unto the legions on the other side!<br>Let them set on at once, for I perceive<br>But cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing,<br>And sudden push gives them the overthrow.<br>Ride, ride, Messala! Let them all come down.
BRUTUS	5	3	2515	2515	1	7	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
BRUTUS	5	3	2517	2517	1	4	Titinius’ face is upward.
BRUTUS	5	3	2519	2521	3	20	O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet;<br>Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords<br>In our own proper entrails.
BRUTUS	5	3	2524	2537	14	105	Are yet two Romans living such as these?—<br>The last of all the Romans, fare thee well.<br>It is impossible that ever Rome<br>Should breed thy fellow.—Friends, I owe more<br>tears<br>To this dead man than you shall see me pay.—<br>I shall find time, Cassius; I shall find time.—<br>Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.<br>His funerals shall not be in our camp,<br>Lest it discomfort us.—Lucilius, come.—<br>And come, young Cato. Let us to the field.—<br>Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on.<br>’Tis three o’clock, and, Romans, yet ere night<br>We shall try fortune in a second fight.
BRUTUS	5	4	2538	2538	1	8	Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
BRUTUS	5	5	2571	2571	1	9	Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
BRUTUS	5	5	2574	2575	2	17	Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word;<br>It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
BRUTUS	5	5	2577	2577	1	4	Peace, then, no words.
BRUTUS	5	5	2579	2579	1	3	Hark thee, Dardanus.
BRUTUS	5	5	2587	2587	1	7	Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word.
BRUTUS	5	5	2589	2593	5	33	Why this, Volumnius:<br>The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me<br>Two several times by night—at Sardis once<br>And this last night here in Philippi fields.<br>I know my hour is come.
BRUTUS	5	5	2595	2602	8	69	Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.<br>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.<br>Our enemies have beat us to the pit.<br>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves<br>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,<br>Thou know’st that we two went to school together;<br>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,<br>Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it.
BRUTUS	5	5	2605	2616	12	95	Farewell to you—and you—and you, Volumnius.—<br>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.<br>Farewell to thee, too, Strato.—Countrymen,<br>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life<br>I found no man but he was true to me.<br>I shall have glory by this losing day<br>More than Octavius and Mark Antony<br>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.<br>So fare you well at once, for Brutus’ tongue<br>Hath almost ended his life’s history.<br>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,<br>That have but labored to attain this hour.
BRUTUS	5	5	2618	2623	6	54	Hence. I will follow.<br>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.<br>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;<br>Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.<br>Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face<br>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
BRUTUS	5	5	2625	2627	3	22	Farewell, good Strato.<br>Caesar, now be still.<br>I killed not thee with half so good a will.
CAESAR	1	2	102	102	1	4	What man is that?
CAESAR	1	2	104	104	1	9	Set him before me. Let me see his face.
CAESAR	1	2	107	107	1	9	What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again.
CAESAR	1	2	109	109	1	9	He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.
CAESAR	1	2	280	280	1	1	Antonius.
CAESAR	1	2	282	285	4	32	Let me have men about me that are fat,<br>Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.<br>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.<br>He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.
CAESAR	1	2	288	304	17	146	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.<br>Yet if my name were liable to fear,<br>I do not know the man I should avoid<br>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,<br>He is a great observer, and he looks<br>Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,<br>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;<br>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort<br>As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit<br>That could be moved to smile at anything.<br>Such men as he be never at heart’s ease<br>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<br>And therefore are they very dangerous.<br>I rather tell thee what is to be feared<br>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.<br>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br>And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.
CAESAR	1	2	81	81	1	1	Calphurnia.
CAESAR	1	2	83	83	1	1	Calphurnia.
CAESAR	1	2	85	86	2	13	Stand you directly in Antonius’ way<br>When he doth run his course.—Antonius.
CAESAR	1	2	88	91	4	25	Forget not in your speed, Antonius,<br>To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say<br>The barren, touchèd in this holy chase,<br>Shake off their sterile curse.
CAESAR	1	2	94	94	1	7	Set on and leave no ceremony out.
CAESAR	1	2	96	96	1	3	Ha! Who calls?
CAESAR	1	2	98	100	3	27	Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br>I hear a tongue shriller than all the music<br>Cry <span class="quote" data-words="1">Caesar.</span> Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.
CAESAR	2	2	1005	1007	3	31	Mark Antony shall say I am not well,<br>And for thy humor I will stay at home.<br>Here’s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so.
CAESAR	2	2	1010	1014	5	42	And you are come in very happy time<br>To bear my greeting to the Senators<br>And tell them that I will not come today.<br>Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser.<br>I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.
CAESAR	2	2	1016	1019	4	30	Shall Caesar send a lie?<br>Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far,<br>To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth?<br>Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
CAESAR	2	2	1022	1033	12	96	The cause is in my will. I will not come.<br>That is enough to satisfy the Senate.<br>But for your private satisfaction,<br>Because I love you, I will let you know.<br>Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.<br>She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,<br>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,<br>Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans<br>Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.<br>And these does she apply for warnings and portents<br>And evils imminent, and on her knee<br>Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
CAESAR	2	2	1042	1042	1	8	And this way have you well expounded it.
CAESAR	2	2	1056	1059	4	42	How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!<br>I am ashamèd I did yield to them.<br>Give me my robe, for I will go.<br>And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
CAESAR	2	2	1061	1066	6	35	Welcome, Publius.—<br>What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?—<br>Good morrow, Casca.—Caius Ligarius,<br>Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy<br>As that same ague which hath made you lean.—<br>What is ’t o’clock?
CAESAR	2	2	1068	1070	3	22	I thank you for your pains and courtesy.<br>See, Antony that revels long a-nights<br>Is notwithstanding up.—Good morrow, Antony.
CAESAR	2	2	1072	1077	6	45	Bid them prepare within.—<br>I am to blame to be thus waited for.<br>Now, Cinna.—Now, Metellus.—What, Trebonius,<br>I have an hour’s talk in store for you.<br>Remember that you call on me today;<br>Be near me that I may remember you.
CAESAR	2	2	1080	1081	2	18	Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,<br>And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
CAESAR	2	2	947	949	3	24	Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.<br>Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out<br><span class="quote" data-words="5">Help ho, they murder Caesar!</span>—Who’s within?
CAESAR	2	2	950	950	1	2	My lord.
CAESAR	2	2	951	952	2	14	Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,<br>And bring me their opinions of success.
CAESAR	2	2	953	953	1	4	I will, my lord.
CAESAR	2	2	956	958	3	25	Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me<br>Ne’er looked but on my back. When they shall see<br>The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.
CAESAR	2	2	973	976	4	29	What can be avoided<br>Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?<br>Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions<br>Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
CAESAR	2	2	980	986	7	53	Cowards die many times before their deaths;<br>The valiant never taste of death but once.<br>Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,<br>It seems to me most strange that men should fear,<br>Seeing that death, a necessary end,<br>Will come when it will come.<br>What say the augurers?
CAESAR	2	2	987	989	3	25	They would not have you to stir forth today.<br>Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,<br>They could not find a heart within the beast.
CAESAR	2	2	990	997	8	60	The gods do this in shame of cowardice.<br>Caesar should be a beast without a heart<br>If he should stay at home today for fear.<br>No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well<br>That Caesar is more dangerous than he.<br>We are two lions littered in one day,<br>And I the elder and more terrible.<br>And Caesar shall go forth.
CAESAR	3	1	1154	1154	1	6	The ides of March are come.
CAESAR	3	1	1161	1161	1	8	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
CAESAR	3	1	1163	1163	1	5	What, is the fellow mad?
CAESAR	3	1	1187	1188	2	15	Are we all ready? What is now amiss<br>That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
CAESAR	3	1	1192	1206	15	101	I must prevent thee, Cimber.<br>These couchings and these lowly courtesies<br>Might fire the blood of ordinary men<br>And turn preordinance and first decree<br>Into the law of children. Be not fond<br>To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<br>That will be thawed from the true quality<br>With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet<br>words,<br>Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.<br>Thy brother by decree is banishèd.<br>If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,<br>I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.<br>Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause<br>Will he be satisfied.
CAESAR	3	1	1213	1213	1	2	What, Brutus?
CAESAR	3	1	1217	1232	16	133	I could be well moved, if I were as you.<br>If I could pray to move, prayers would move me.<br>But I am constant as the Northern Star,<br>Of whose true fixed and resting quality<br>There is no fellow in the firmament.<br>The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks;<br>They are all fire, and every one doth shine.<br>But there’s but one in all doth hold his place.<br>So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men,<br>And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive.<br>Yet in the number I do know but one<br>That unassailable holds on his rank,<br>Unshaked of motion; and that I am he<br>Let me a little show it, even in this:<br>That I was constant Cimber should be banished<br>And constant do remain to keep him so.
CAESAR	3	1	1234	1234	1	6	Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
CAESAR	3	1	1236	1236	1	5	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CAESAR	3	1	1238	1238	1	6	<span class="foreign" data-words="3" data-lang="la">Et tu, Brutè</span>?—Then fall, Caesar.
CAESAR	4	3	2242	2242	1	4	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
CAESAR	4	3	2244	2244	1	9	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
CAESAR	4	3	2246	2246	1	3	Ay, at Philippi.
CAESARS_SERVANT	2	2	950	950	1	2	My lord.
CAESARS_SERVANT	2	2	953	953	1	4	I will, my lord.
CAESARS_SERVANT	2	2	987	989	3	25	They would not have you to stir forth today.<br>Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,<br>They could not find a heart within the beast.
CALPHURNIA	1	2	84	84	1	3	Here, my lord.
CALPHURNIA	2	2	1015	1015	1	4	Say he is sick.
CALPHURNIA	2	2	954	955	2	18	What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?<br>You shall not stir out of your house today.
CALPHURNIA	2	2	959	972	14	108	Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,<br>Yet now they fright me. There is one within,<br>Besides the things that we have heard and seen,<br>Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<br>A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets,<br>And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.<br>Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds<br>In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,<br>Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.<br>The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<br>Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<br>And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<br>O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,<br>And I do fear them.
CALPHURNIA	2	2	977	979	3	17	When beggars die there are no comets seen;<br>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of<br>princes.
CALPHURNIA	2	2	998	1004	7	53	Alas, my lord,<br>Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.<br>Do not go forth today. Call it my fear<br>That keeps you in the house, and not your own.<br>We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,<br>And he shall say you are not well today.<br>Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
CARPENTER	1	1	6	6	1	4	Why, sir, a carpenter.
CASCA	1	2	305	306	2	11	You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak<br>with me?
CASCA	1	2	309	309	1	8	Why, you were with him, were you not?
CASCA	1	2	311	313	3	28	Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being<br>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,<br>thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.
CASCA	1	2	315	315	1	4	Why, for that too.
CASCA	1	2	317	317	1	4	Why, for that too.
CASCA	1	2	319	321	3	23	Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every<br>time gentler than other; and at every putting-by,<br>mine honest neighbors shouted.
CASCA	1	2	323	323	1	2	Why, Antony.
CASCA	1	2	325	341	17	172	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.<br>It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark<br>Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown<br>neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told<br>you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my<br>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered<br>it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my<br>thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.<br>And then he offered it the third time. He put it the<br>third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement<br>hooted and clapped their chopped hands and<br>threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a<br>deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the<br>crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he<br>swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,<br>I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and<br>receiving the bad air.
CASCA	1	2	343	344	2	13	He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at<br>mouth and was speechless.
CASCA	1	2	348	352	5	48	I know not what you mean by that, but I am<br>sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not<br>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and<br>displeased them, as they use to do the players in the<br>theater, I am no true man.
CASCA	1	2	354	366	13	128	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived<br>the common herd was glad he refused the crown,<br>he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his<br>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,<br>if I would not have taken him at a word, I<br>would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so<br>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he<br>had done or said anything amiss, he desired their<br>Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four<br>wenches where I stood cried <span class="quote" data-words="3">Alas, good soul!</span> and<br>forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no<br>heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed<br>their mothers, they would have done no less.
CASCA	1	2	368	368	1	1	Ay.
CASCA	1	2	370	370	1	4	Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASCA	1	2	372	379	8	70	Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’<br>face again. But those that understood him smiled at<br>one another and shook their heads. But for mine<br>own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more<br>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves<br>off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you<br>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember<br>it.
CASCA	1	2	381	381	1	5	No, I am promised forth.
CASCA	1	2	383	384	2	15	Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your<br>dinner worth the eating.
CASCA	1	2	386	386	1	4	Do so. Farewell both.
CASCA	1	2	82	82	1	4	Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
CASCA	1	2	97	97	1	8	Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again!
CASCA	1	3	417	427	11	86	Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth<br>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,<br>I have seen tempests when the scolding winds<br>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen<br>Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam<br>To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds;<br>But never till tonight, never till now,<br>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.<br>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,<br>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,<br>Incenses them to send destruction.
CASCA	1	3	429	446	18	138	A common slave (you know him well by sight)<br>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<br>Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,<br>Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.<br>Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword),<br>Against the Capitol I met a lion,<br>Who glazed upon me and went surly by<br>Without annoying me. And there were drawn<br>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<br>Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw<br>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.<br>And yesterday the bird of night did sit<br>Even at noonday upon the marketplace,<br>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<br>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say<br><span class="quote" data-words="7">These are their reasons, they are natural,</span><br>For I believe they are portentous things<br>Unto the climate that they point upon.
CASCA	1	3	451	452	2	16	He doth, for he did bid Antonius<br>Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
CASCA	1	3	455	455	1	2	Farewell, Cicero
CASCA	1	3	457	457	1	2	A Roman.
CASCA	1	3	459	459	1	9	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
CASCA	1	3	461	461	1	7	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASCA	1	3	470	473	4	33	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?<br>It is the part of men to fear and tremble<br>When the most mighty gods by tokens send<br>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASCA	1	3	496	496	1	9	’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
CASCA	1	3	502	505	4	30	Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow<br>Mean to establish Caesar as a king,<br>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land<br>In every place save here in Italy.
CASCA	1	3	518	520	3	17	So can I.<br>So every bondman in his own hand bears<br>The power to cancel his captivity.
CASCA	1	3	534	538	5	42	You speak to Casca, and to such a man<br>That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.<br>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,<br>And I will set this foot of mine as far<br>As who goes farthest.
CASCA	1	3	550	550	1	9	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASCA	1	3	576	579	4	29	O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts,<br>And that which would appear offense in us<br>His countenance, like richest alchemy,<br>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
CASCA	2	1	695	695	1	1	No.
CASCA	2	1	698	705	8	57	You shall confess that you are both deceived.<br>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,<br>Which is a great way growing on the south,<br>Weighing the youthful season of the year.<br>Some two months hence, up higher toward the<br>north<br>He first presents his fire, and the high east<br>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
CASCA	2	1	737	737	1	6	Let us not leave him out.
CASCA	2	1	749	749	1	5	Indeed, he is not fit.
CASCA	3	1	1237	1237	1	4	Speak, hands, for me!
CASCA	3	1	1245	1245	1	5	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
CASCA	3	1	1266	1267	2	17	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life<br>Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
CASSIUS	1	2	105	106	2	12	Fellow, come from the throng.<br>Look upon Caesar.
CASSIUS	1	2	110	110	1	9	Will you go see the order of the course?
CASSIUS	1	2	112	112	1	4	I pray you, do.
CASSIUS	1	2	117	121	5	41	Brutus, I do observe you now of late.<br>I have not from your eyes that gentleness<br>And show of love as I was wont to have.<br>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<br>Over your friend that loves you.
CASSIUS	1	2	134	137	4	32	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,<br>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<br>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<br>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
CASSIUS	1	2	140	148	9	61	’Tis just.<br>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<br>That you have no such mirrors as will turn<br>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<br>That you might see your shadow. I have heard<br>Where many of the best respect in Rome,<br>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus<br>And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,<br>Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
CASSIUS	1	2	152	164	13	99	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.<br>And since you know you cannot see yourself<br>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<br>Will modestly discover to yourself<br>That of yourself which you yet know not of.<br>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.<br>Were I a common laughter, or did use<br>To stale with ordinary oaths my love<br>To every new protester; if you know<br>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard<br>And after scandal them, or if you know<br>That I profess myself in banqueting<br>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
CASSIUS	1	2	167	168	2	15	Ay, do you fear it?<br>Then must I think you would not have it so.
CASSIUS	1	2	177	216	42	350	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br>As well as I do know your outward favor.<br>Well, honor is the subject of my story.<br>I cannot tell what you and other men<br>Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br>I had as lief not be as live to be<br>In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>I was born free as Caesar; so were you;<br>We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.<br>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br>Caesar said to me <span class="quote" data-words="17">Dar’st thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry flood<br>And swim to yonder point?</span> Upon the word,<br>Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in<br>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<br>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it<br>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.<br>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br>Caesar cried <span class="quote" data-words="6">Help me, Cassius, or I sink!</span><br>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br>Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>A wretched creature and must bend his body<br>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br>And when the fit was on him, I did mark<br>How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.<br>His coward lips did from their color fly,<br>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.<br>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Alas,</span> it cried <span class="quote" data-words="5">Give me some drink, Titinius</span><br>As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me<br>A man of such a feeble temper should<br>So get the start of the majestic world<br>And bear the palm alone.
CASSIUS	1	2	222	250	29	231	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br>To find ourselves dishonorable graves.<br>Men at some time are masters of their fates.<br>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Brutus</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">Caesar</span>—what should be in that<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Caesar</span>?<br>Why should that name be sounded more than<br>yours?<br>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Brutus</span> will start a spirit as soon as <span class="quote" data-words="1">Caesar.</span><br>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed<br>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<br>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br>When went there by an age, since the great flood,<br>But it was famed with more than with one man?<br>When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,<br>That her wide walks encompassed but one man?<br>Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough<br>When there is in it but one only man.<br>O, you and I have heard our fathers say<br>There was a Brutus once that would have brooked<br>Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>As easily as a king.
CASSIUS	1	2	265	267	3	17	I am glad that my weak words<br>Have struck but thus much show of fire from<br>Brutus.
CASSIUS	1	2	269	271	3	24	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,<br>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you<br>What hath proceeded worthy note today.
CASSIUS	1	2	279	279	1	8	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CASSIUS	1	2	316	316	1	9	They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
CASSIUS	1	2	322	322	1	5	Who offered him the crown?
CASSIUS	1	2	342	342	1	9	But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
CASSIUS	1	2	346	347	2	17	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I<br>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
CASSIUS	1	2	369	369	1	4	Did Cicero say anything?
CASSIUS	1	2	371	371	1	3	To what effect?
CASSIUS	1	2	380	380	1	7	Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
CASSIUS	1	2	382	382	1	6	Will you dine with me tomorrow?
CASSIUS	1	2	385	385	1	5	Good. I will expect you.
CASSIUS	1	2	389	394	6	39	So is he now in execution<br>Of any bold or noble enterprise,<br>However he puts on this tardy form.<br>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,<br>Which gives men stomach to digest his words<br>With better appetite.
CASSIUS	1	2	399	414	16	131	I will do so. Till then, think of the world.<br>Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see<br>Thy honorable mettle may be wrought<br>From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet<br>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<br>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?<br>Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.<br>If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,<br>He should not humor me. I will this night<br>In several hands in at his windows throw,<br>As if they came from several citizens,<br>Writings, all tending to the great opinion<br>That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely<br>Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at<br>And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,<br>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
CASSIUS	1	3	456	456	1	2	Who’s there?
CASSIUS	1	3	458	458	1	4	Casca, by your voice.
CASSIUS	1	3	460	460	1	7	A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASSIUS	1	3	462	469	8	65	Those that have known the earth so full of faults.<br>For my part, I have walked about the streets,<br>Submitting me unto the perilous night,<br>And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,<br>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;<br>And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open<br>The breast of heaven, I did present myself<br>Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASSIUS	1	3	474	495	22	166	You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life<br>That should be in a Roman you do want,<br>Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,<br>And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,<br>To see the strange impatience of the heavens.<br>But if you would consider the true cause<br>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,<br>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,<br>Why old men, fools, and children calculate,<br>Why all these things change from their ordinance,<br>Their natures, and preformèd faculties,<br>To monstrous quality—why, you shall find<br>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits<br>To make them instruments of fear and warning<br>Unto some monstrous state.<br>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man<br>Most like this dreadful night,<br>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars<br>As doth the lion in the Capitol;<br>A man no mightier than thyself or me<br>In personal action, yet prodigious grown,<br>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
CASSIUS	1	3	497	501	5	41	Let it be who it is. For Romans now<br>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.<br>But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,<br>And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.<br>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
CASSIUS	1	3	506	517	12	92	I know where I will wear this dagger then;<br>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.<br>Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;<br>Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.<br>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,<br>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,<br>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;<br>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,<br>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.<br>If I know this, know all the world besides,<br>That part of tyranny that I do bear<br>I can shake off at pleasure.
CASSIUS	1	3	521	533	13	107	And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?<br>Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf<br>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;<br>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.<br>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire<br>Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,<br>What rubbish, and what offal when it serves<br>For the base matter to illuminate<br>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,<br>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this<br>Before a willing bondman; then, I know<br>My answer must be made. But I am armed,<br>And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASSIUS	1	3	539	549	11	76	There’s a bargain made.<br>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already<br>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans<br>To undergo with me an enterprise<br>Of honorable-dangerous consequence.<br>And I do know by this they stay for me<br>In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,<br>There is no stir or walking in the streets;<br>And the complexion of the element<br>In favor ’s like the work we have in hand,<br>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
CASSIUS	1	3	551	552	2	18	’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.<br>He is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so?
CASSIUS	1	3	554	555	2	15	No, it is Casca, one incorporate<br>To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
CASSIUS	1	3	558	558	1	7	Am I not stayed for? Tell me.
CASSIUS	1	3	561	567	7	57	Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,<br>And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair,<br>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this<br>In at his window; set this up with wax<br>Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,<br>Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.<br>Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CASSIUS	1	3	571	575	5	40	That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater.<br>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day<br>See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him<br>Is ours already, and the man entire<br>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
CASSIUS	1	3	580	583	4	35	Him and his worth and our great need of him<br>You have right well conceited. Let us go,<br>For it is after midnight, and ere day<br>We will awake him and be sure of him.
CASSIUS	2	1	677	678	2	16	I think we are too bold upon your rest.<br>Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?
CASSIUS	2	1	681	685	5	34	Yes, every man of them; and no man here<br>But honors you, and every one doth wish<br>You had but that opinion of yourself<br>Which every noble Roman bears of you.<br>This is Trebonius.
CASSIUS	2	1	687	687	1	3	This, Decius Brutus.
CASSIUS	2	1	689	689	1	8	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
CASSIUS	2	1	693	693	1	5	Shall I entreat a word?
CASSIUS	2	1	707	707	1	6	And let us swear our resolution.
CASSIUS	2	1	735	736	2	17	But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?<br>I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASSIUS	2	1	748	748	1	4	Then leave him out.
CASSIUS	2	1	751	757	7	55	Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet<br>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,<br>Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him<br>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,<br>If he improve them, may well stretch so far<br>As to annoy us all; which to prevent,<br>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
CASSIUS	2	1	780	781	2	13	Yet I fear him,<br>For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar—
CASSIUS	2	1	790	791	2	5	The clock hath stricken<br>three.
CASSIUS	2	1	793	801	9	59	But it is doubtful yet<br>Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,<br>For he is superstitious grown of late,<br>Quite from the main opinion he held once<br>Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.<br>It may be these apparent prodigies,<br>The unaccustomed terror of this night,<br>And the persuasion of his augurers<br>May hold him from the Capitol today.
CASSIUS	2	1	812	812	1	11	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
CASSIUS	2	1	821	825	5	25	The morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you,<br>Brutus.<br>And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember<br>What you have said, and show yourselves true<br>Romans.
CASSIUS	3	1	1165	1166	2	12	What, urge you your petitions in the street?<br>Come to the Capitol.
CASSIUS	3	1	1168	1168	1	3	What enterprise, Popilius?
CASSIUS	3	1	1171	1172	2	13	He wished today our enterprise might thrive.<br>I fear our purpose is discoverèd.
CASSIUS	3	1	1174	1177	4	28	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.—<br>Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,<br>Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,<br>For I will slay myself.
CASSIUS	3	1	1181	1182	2	16	Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,<br>He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
CASSIUS	3	1	1214	1216	3	19	Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon!<br>As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall<br>To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
CASSIUS	3	1	1241	1242	2	12	Some to the common pulpits and cry out<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.</span>
CASSIUS	3	1	1254	1255	2	17	And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,<br>Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
CASSIUS	3	1	1258	1258	1	3	Where is Antony?
CASSIUS	3	1	1276	1279	4	32	Stoop then, and wash.<br>How many ages hence<br>Shall this our lofty scene be acted over<br>In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
CASSIUS	3	1	1283	1285	3	22	So oft as that shall be,<br>So often shall the knot of us be called<br>The men that gave their country liberty.
CASSIUS	3	1	1287	1289	3	22	Ay, every man away.<br>Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels<br>With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
CASSIUS	3	1	1313	1315	3	23	I wish we may; but yet have I a mind<br>That fears him much, and my misgiving still<br>Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
CASSIUS	3	1	1346	1347	2	15	Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s<br>In the disposing of new dignities.
CASSIUS	3	1	1384	1384	1	2	Mark Antony—
CASSIUS	3	1	1388	1391	4	35	I blame you not for praising Caesar so.<br>But what compact mean you to have with us?<br>Will you be pricked in number of our friends,<br>Or shall we on and not depend on you?
CASSIUS	3	1	1407	1412	6	38	Brutus, a word with you.<br>You know not what you do. Do<br>not consent<br>That Antony speak in his funeral.<br>Know you how much the people may be moved<br>By that which he will utter?
CASSIUS	3	1	1421	1421	1	10	I know not what may fall. I like it not.
CASSIUS	4	2	1895	1895	1	2	Stand ho!
CASSIUS	4	2	1900	1900	1	8	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
CASSIUS	4	2	1903	1904	2	13	Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,<br>And when you do them—
CASSIUS	4	2	1912	1914	3	13	Pindarus,<br>Bid our commanders lead their charges off<br>A little from this ground.
CASSIUS	4	3	1918	1922	5	38	That you have wronged me doth appear in this:<br>You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella<br>For taking bribes here of the Sardians,<br>Wherein my letters, praying on his side<br>Because I knew the man, was slighted off.
CASSIUS	4	3	1924	1925	2	18	In such a time as this it is not meet<br>That every nice offense should bear his comment.
CASSIUS	4	3	1930	1932	3	23	I an itching palm?<br>You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,<br>Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
CASSIUS	4	3	1935	1935	1	1	Chastisement?
CASSIUS	4	3	1947	1951	5	29	Brutus, bait not me.<br>I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself<br>To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,<br>Older in practice, abler than yourself<br>To make conditions.
CASSIUS	4	3	1953	1953	1	2	I am.
CASSIUS	4	3	1955	1956	2	17	Urge me no more. I shall forget myself.<br>Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther.
CASSIUS	4	3	1958	1958	1	3	Is ’t possible?
CASSIUS	4	3	1962	1962	1	10	O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this?
CASSIUS	4	3	1972	1972	1	5	Is it come to this?
CASSIUS	4	3	1977	1979	3	21	You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.<br>I said an elder soldier, not a better.<br>Did I say <span class="quote" data-words="1">better</span>?
CASSIUS	4	3	1981	1982	2	10	When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved<br>me.
CASSIUS	4	3	1984	1984	1	3	I durst not?
CASSIUS	4	3	1986	1986	1	5	What? Durst not tempt him?
CASSIUS	4	3	1989	1990	2	17	Do not presume too much upon my love.<br>I may do that I shall be sorry for.
CASSIUS	4	3	2009	2009	1	4	I denied you not.
CASSIUS	4	3	2011	2014	4	33	I did not. He was but a fool that brought<br>My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.<br>A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities,<br>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
CASSIUS	4	3	2016	2016	1	4	You love me not.
CASSIUS	4	3	2018	2018	1	8	A friendly eye could never see such faults.
CASSIUS	4	3	2021	2036	16	124	Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come!<br>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<br>For Cassius is aweary of the world—<br>Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,<br>Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed,<br>Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote<br>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<br>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,<br>And here my naked breast; within, a heart<br>Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold.<br>If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.<br>I that denied thee gold will give my heart.<br>Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know<br>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him<br>better<br>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
CASSIUS	4	3	2045	2047	3	19	Hath Cassius lived<br>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus<br>When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?
CASSIUS	4	3	2049	2049	1	9	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
CASSIUS	4	3	2051	2051	1	2	O Brutus!
CASSIUS	4	3	2053	2055	3	21	Have not you love enough to bear with me<br>When that rash humor which my mother gave me<br>Makes me forgetful?
CASSIUS	4	3	2065	2065	1	5	How now, what’s the matter?
CASSIUS	4	3	2069	2069	1	8	Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
CASSIUS	4	3	2071	2071	1	7	Bear with him, Brutus. ’Tis his fashion.
CASSIUS	4	3	2075	2075	1	4	Away, away, be gone!
CASSIUS	4	3	2078	2079	2	11	And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you<br>Immediately to us.
CASSIUS	4	3	2081	2081	1	10	I did not think you could have been so angry.
CASSIUS	4	3	2083	2084	2	14	Of your philosophy you make no use<br>If you give place to accidental evils.
CASSIUS	4	3	2086	2086	1	2	Ha? Portia?
CASSIUS	4	3	2088	2090	3	17	How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so?<br>O insupportable and touching loss!<br>Upon what sickness?
CASSIUS	4	3	2097	2097	1	3	And died so?
CASSIUS	4	3	2099	2099	1	4	O you immortal gods!
CASSIUS	4	3	2102	2104	3	24	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.—<br>Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup;<br>I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.
CASSIUS	4	3	2108	2108	1	4	Portia, art thou gone?
CASSIUS	4	3	2122	2122	1	2	Cicero one?
CASSIUS	4	3	2139	2140	2	19	I have as much of this in art as you,<br>But yet my nature could not bear it so.
CASSIUS	4	3	2143	2143	1	6	I do not think it good.
CASSIUS	4	3	2145	2149	5	33	This it is:<br>’Tis better that the enemy seek us;<br>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<br>Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still,<br>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
CASSIUS	4	3	2160	2160	1	4	Hear me, good brother—
CASSIUS	4	3	2173	2174	2	14	Then, with your will, go on;<br>We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.
CASSIUS	4	3	2179	2180	2	13	No more. Good night.<br>Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
CASSIUS	4	3	2186	2189	4	23	O my dear brother,<br>This was an ill beginning of the night.<br>Never come such division ’tween our souls!<br>Let it not, Brutus.
CASSIUS	4	3	2191	2191	1	4	Good night, my lord.
CASSIUS	5	1	2295	2295	1	8	Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.
CASSIUS	5	1	2306	2309	4	22	Antony,<br>The posture of your blows are yet unknown,<br>But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees<br>And leave them honeyless.
CASSIUS	5	1	2321	2323	3	17	Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself!<br>This tongue had not offended so today<br>If Cassius might have ruled.
CASSIUS	5	1	2337	2338	2	14	A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,<br>Joined with a masker and a reveler!
CASSIUS	5	1	2344	2345	2	19	Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!<br>The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
CASSIUS	5	1	2348	2348	1	1	Messala.
CASSIUS	5	1	2350	2368	19	138	Messala,<br>This is my birthday, as this very day<br>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.<br>Be thou my witness that against my will<br>(As Pompey was) am I compelled to set<br>Upon one battle all our liberties.<br>You know that I held Epicurus strong<br>And his opinion. Now I change my mind<br>And partly credit things that do presage.<br>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<br>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,<br>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,<br>Who to Philippi here consorted us.<br>This morning are they fled away and gone,<br>And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites<br>Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us<br>As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem<br>A canopy most fatal, under which<br>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
CASSIUS	5	1	2370	2372	3	19	I but believe it partly,<br>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved<br>To meet all perils very constantly.
CASSIUS	5	1	2374	2381	8	62	Now, most noble Brutus,<br>The gods today stand friendly that we may,<br>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.<br>But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,<br>Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.<br>If we do lose this battle, then is this<br>The very last time we shall speak together.<br>What are you then determinèd to do?
CASSIUS	5	1	2390	2392	3	19	Then, if we lose this battle,<br>You are contented to be led in triumph<br>Thorough the streets of Rome?
CASSIUS	5	1	2402	2404	3	22	Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.<br>If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;<br>If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.
CASSIUS	5	3	2415	2418	4	32	O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!<br>Myself have to mine own turned enemy.<br>This ensign here of mine was turning back;<br>I slew the coward and did take it from him.
CASSIUS	5	3	2426	2427	2	17	This hill is far enough.—Look, look, Titinius,<br>Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
CASSIUS	5	3	2429	2433	5	39	Titinius, if thou lovest me,<br>Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him<br>Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops<br>And here again, that I may rest assured<br>Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
CASSIUS	5	3	2435	2440	6	53	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.<br>My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius<br>And tell me what thou not’st about the field.<br>This day I breathèd first. Time is come round,<br>And where I did begin, there shall I end;<br>My life is run his compass.—Sirrah, what news?
CASSIUS	5	3	2442	2442	1	2	What news?
CASSIUS	5	3	2449	2465	17	114	Come down, behold no more.—<br>O, coward that I am to live so long<br>To see my best friend ta’en before my face!<br>Come hither, sirrah.<br>In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,<br>And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,<br>That whatsoever I did bid thee do<br>Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine<br>oath.<br>Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,<br>That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this<br>bosom.<br>Stand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts,<br>And, when my face is covered, as ’tis now,<br>Guide thou the sword.<br>Caesar, thou art revenged<br>Even with the sword that killed thee.
CATO	5	3	2518	2518	1	3	He is slain.
CATO	5	3	2522	2523	2	10	Brave Titinius!—<br>Look whe’er he have not crowned dead Cassius.
CATO	5	4	2539	2543	5	41	What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?<br>I will proclaim my name about the field.<br>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!<br>A foe to tyrants and my country’s friend.<br>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
CICERO	1	3	415	416	2	16	Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?<br>Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?
CICERO	1	3	428	428	1	6	Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
CICERO	1	3	447	450	4	28	Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.<br>But men may construe things after their fashion,<br>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.<br>Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
CICERO	1	3	453	454	2	12	Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd sky<br>Is not to walk in.
CINNA	1	3	553	553	1	8	To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?
CINNA	1	3	556	557	2	21	I am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this!<br>There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
CINNA	1	3	559	560	2	16	Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could<br>But win the noble Brutus to our party—
CINNA	1	3	568	570	3	26	All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone<br>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie<br>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
CINNA	2	1	696	697	2	17	O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines<br>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
CINNA	2	1	738	738	1	4	No, by no means.
CINNA	2	1	814	814	1	8	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
CINNA	3	1	1186	1186	1	9	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CINNA	3	1	1233	1233	1	2	O Caesar—
CINNA	3	1	1239	1240	2	13	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!<br>Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
CINNA	3	1	1248	1248	1	6	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
CINNA	3	3	1765	1768	4	29	I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,<br>And things unluckily charge my fantasy.<br>I have no will to wander forth of doors,<br>Yet something leads me forth.
CINNA	3	3	1778	1781	4	38	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where<br>do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor?<br>Then to answer every man directly and briefly,<br>wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
CINNA	3	3	1785	1785	1	7	Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.
CINNA	3	3	1787	1787	1	3	As a friend.
CINNA	3	3	1790	1790	1	6	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
CINNA	3	3	1792	1792	1	5	Truly, my name is Cinna.
CINNA	3	3	1794	1794	1	10	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet!
CINNA	3	3	1797	1797	1	6	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1765	1768	4	29	I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,<br>And things unluckily charge my fantasy.<br>I have no will to wander forth of doors,<br>Yet something leads me forth.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1778	1781	4	38	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where<br>do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor?<br>Then to answer every man directly and briefly,<br>wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1785	1785	1	7	Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1787	1787	1	3	As a friend.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1790	1790	1	6	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1792	1792	1	5	Truly, my name is Cinna.
CINNA_POET	3	3	1794	1794	1	10	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet!
CINNA_POET	3	3	1797	1797	1	6	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
CLAUDIUS-JC	4	3	2263	2263	1	2	My lord?
CLAUDIUS-JC	4	3	2265	2265	1	4	Did we, my lord?
CLAUDIUS-JC	4	3	2268	2268	1	4	Nor I, my lord.
CLAUDIUS-JC	4	3	2272	2272	1	6	It shall be done, my lord.
CLITUS	5	5	2572	2573	2	17	Statilius showed the torchlight, but, my lord,<br>He came not back. He is or ta’en or slain.
CLITUS	5	5	2576	2576	1	10	What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
CLITUS	5	5	2578	2578	1	4	I’ll rather kill myself.
CLITUS	5	5	2581	2581	1	2	O Dardanus!
CLITUS	5	5	2583	2583	1	8	What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
CLITUS	5	5	2585	2586	2	16	Now is that noble vessel full of grief,<br>That it runs over even at his eyes.
CLITUS	5	5	2604	2604	1	9	Fly, fly, my lord! There is no tarrying here.
CLITUS	5	5	2617	2617	1	4	Fly, my lord, fly!
COBBLER	1	1	10	11	2	17	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am<br>but, as you would say, a cobbler.
COBBLER	1	1	13	15	3	22	A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe<br>conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad<br>soles.
COBBLER	1	1	18	19	2	20	Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.<br>Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
COBBLER	1	1	22	22	1	4	Why, sir, cobble you.
COBBLER	1	1	24	29	6	54	Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the<br>awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor<br>women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a<br>surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger,<br>I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon<br>neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.
COBBLER	1	1	32	35	4	28	Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to<br>get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we<br>make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his<br>triumph.
DARDANUS	5	5	2580	2580	1	6	Shall I do such a deed?
DARDANUS	5	5	2582	2582	1	2	O Clitus!
DARDANUS	5	5	2584	2584	1	7	To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
DECIUS	2	1	694	694	1	10	Here lies the east; doth not the day break here?
DECIUS	2	1	750	750	1	9	Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?
DECIUS	2	1	802	811	10	74	Never fear that. If he be so resolved,<br>I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear<br>That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,<br>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<br>Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.<br>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,<br>He says he does, being then most flatterèd.<br>Let me work,<br>For I can give his humor the true bent,<br>And I will bring him to the Capitol.
DECIUS	2	2	1008	1009	2	16	Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.<br>I come to fetch you to the Senate House.
DECIUS	2	2	1020	1021	2	18	Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,<br>Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
DECIUS	2	2	1034	1041	8	55	This dream is all amiss interpreted.<br>It was a vision fair and fortunate.<br>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,<br>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,<br>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck<br>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press<br>For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.<br>This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.
DECIUS	2	2	1043	1054	13	104	I have, when you have heard what I can say.<br>And know it now: the Senate have concluded<br>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.<br>If you shall send them word you will not come,<br>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock<br>Apt to be rendered, for someone to say<br><span class="quote" data-words="15">Break up the Senate till another time,When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.</span><br>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Lo, Caesar is afraid</span>?<br>Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love<br>To your proceeding bids me tell you this,<br>And reason to my love is liable.
DECIUS	3	1	1157	1158	2	14	Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread,<br>At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
DECIUS	3	1	1183	1184	2	14	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go<br>And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
DECIUS	3	1	1235	1235	1	2	Great Caesar—
DECIUS	3	1	1246	1246	1	3	And Cassius too.
DECIUS	3	1	1286	1286	1	4	What, shall we forth?
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1486	1486	1	5	I will hear Brutus speak.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1528	1528	1	8	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1533	1534	2	10	We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and<br>clamors.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1537	1537	1	2	Peace, ho!
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1545	1545	1	8	Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony!
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1553	1553	1	5	This Caesar was a tyrant.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1595	1595	1	8	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1603	1603	1	10	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1654	1654	1	8	Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1687	1687	1	3	O piteous spectacle!
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1691	1691	1	4	O most bloody sight!
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1696	1696	1	6	Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1722	1722	1	6	We’ll burn the house of Brutus.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1744	1747	4	25	Never, never!—Come, away, away!<br>We’ll burn his body in the holy place<br>And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.<br>Take up the body.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1769	1769	1	4	What is your name?
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1775	1775	1	3	Ay, and briefly.
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1786	1786	1	6	As a friend or an enemy?
FIRST_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1793	1793	1	7	Tear him to pieces! He’s a conspirator.
FIRST_SOLDIER_ANTONY	5	4	2549	2549	1	4	Yield, or thou diest.
FIRST_SOLDIER_ANTONY	5	4	2553	2553	1	6	We must not. A noble prisoner!
FIRST_SOLDIER_ANTONY	5	4	2555	2556	2	16	I’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.—<br>Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord.
FIRST_SOLDIER_BRUTUS	4	2	1897	1897	1	1	Stand!
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	1	5	5	37	Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!<br>Is this a holiday? What, know you not,<br>Being mechanical, you ought not walk<br>Upon a laboring day without the sign<br>Of your profession?—Speak, what trade art thou?
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	16	17	2	9	What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what<br>trade?
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	23	23	1	6	Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	30	31	2	17	But wherefore art not in thy shop today?<br>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	61	70	10	81	Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault<br>Assemble all the poor men of your sort,<br>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears<br>Into the channel, till the lowest stream<br>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.<br>See whe’er their basest mettle be not moved.<br>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.<br>Go you down that way towards the Capitol.<br>This way will I. Disrobe the images<br>If you do find them decked with ceremonies.
FLAVIUS-JC	1	1	73	80	8	61	It is no matter. Let no images<br>Be hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll about<br>And drive away the vulgar from the streets;<br>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.<br>These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing<br>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,<br>Who else would soar above the view of men<br>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1531	1532	2	8	Caesar’s better parts<br>Shall be crowned in Brutus.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1549	1549	1	6	What does he say of Brutus?
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1552	1552	1	9	’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1600	1602	3	17	Marked you his words? He would not take the<br>crown;<br>Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1606	1606	1	8	Now mark him. He begins again to speak.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1627	1627	1	8	We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1636	1636	1	7	Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1642	1642	1	5	They were traitors. Honorable men?
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1653	1653	1	4	A ring; stand round.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1690	1690	1	3	O traitors, villains!
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1750	1751	2	5	Pluck down forms, windows,<br>anything.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1772	1773	2	8	Are you a married man or a<br>bachelor?
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1776	1776	1	3	Ay, and wisely.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1789	1789	1	4	For your dwelling—briefly.
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1795	1796	2	12	Tear him for his bad verses, tear him<br>for his bad verses!
FOURTH_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1798	1800	3	19	It is no matter. His name’s Cinna.<br>Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him<br>going.
LENA	3	1	1167	1167	1	7	I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
LENA	3	1	1169	1169	1	3	Fare you well.
LEPIDUS	4	1	1808	1808	1	3	I do consent.
LEPIDUS	4	1	1810	1811	2	13	Upon condition Publius shall not live,<br>Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.
LEPIDUS	4	1	1816	1816	1	6	What, shall I find you here?
LIGARIUS	2	1	922	922	1	7	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
LIGARIUS	2	1	925	926	2	16	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand<br>Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
LIGARIUS	2	1	929	936	8	57	By all the gods that Romans bow before,<br>I here discard my sickness.<br>Soul of Rome,<br>Brave son derived from honorable loins,<br>Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up<br>My mortifièd spirit. Now bid me run,<br>And I will strive with things impossible,<br>Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?
LIGARIUS	2	1	938	938	1	10	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
LIGARIUS	2	1	942	945	4	26	Set on your foot,<br>And with a heart new-fired I follow you<br>To do I know not what; but it sufficeth<br>That Brutus leads me on.
LUCILIUS	4	2	1861	1861	1	6	Give the word, ho, and stand!
LUCILIUS	4	2	1863	1864	2	15	He is at hand, and Pindarus is come<br>To do you salutation from his master.
LUCILIUS	4	2	1876	1879	4	25	With courtesy and with respect enough,<br>But not with such familiar instances<br>Nor with such free and friendly conference<br>As he hath used of old.
LUCILIUS	4	2	1890	1892	3	20	They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.<br>The greater part, the horse in general,<br>Are come with Cassius.
LUCILIUS	4	3	2063	2063	1	6	You shall not come to them.
LUCILIUS	5	1	2347	2347	1	2	My lord?
LUCILIUS	5	4	2544	2548	5	41	And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!<br>Brutus, my country’s friend! Know me for Brutus.<br>O young and noble Cato, art thou down?<br>Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius<br>And mayst be honored, being Cato’s son.
LUCILIUS	5	4	2550	2552	3	25	Only I yield to die.<br>There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.<br>Kill Brutus and be honored in his death.
LUCILIUS	5	4	2558	2563	6	46	Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.<br>I dare assure thee that no enemy<br>Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.<br>The gods defend him from so great a shame!<br>When you do find him, or alive or dead,<br>He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
LUCILIUS	5	5	2634	2635	2	16	So Brutus should be found.—I thank thee, Brutus,<br>That thou hast proved Lucilius’ saying true.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	1103	1103	1	5	To know my errand, madam.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	1111	1113	3	20	Madam, what should I do?<br>Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?<br>And so return to you, and nothing else?
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	1118	1118	1	4	I hear none, madam.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	1122	1122	1	5	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	589	589	1	4	Called you, my lord?
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	592	592	1	4	I will, my lord.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	620	623	4	34	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.<br>Searching the window for a flint, I found<br>This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure<br>It did not lie there when I went to bed.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	626	626	1	4	I know not, sir.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	628	628	1	3	I will, sir.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	645	645	1	6	Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	656	657	2	14	Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,<br>Who doth desire to see you.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	659	659	1	7	No, sir. There are more with him.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	662	665	4	30	No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,<br>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,<br>That by no means I may discover them<br>By any mark of favor.
LUCIUS-JC	2	1	918	918	1	10	Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2196	2196	1	4	Here in the tent.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2201	2201	1	3	Varro and Claudius.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2212	2212	1	10	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2216	2216	1	7	Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2219	2219	1	5	It is my duty, sir.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2222	2222	1	6	I have slept, my lord, already.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2252	2252	1	6	The strings, my lord, are false.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2255	2255	1	2	My lord?
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2257	2257	1	10	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
LUCIUS-JC	4	3	2259	2259	1	3	Nothing, my lord.
MARULLUS	1	1	12	12	1	8	But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
MARULLUS	1	1	20	21	2	10	What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy<br>fellow?
MARULLUS	1	1	36	60	25	179	Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?<br>What tributaries follow him to Rome<br>To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?<br>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless<br>things!<br>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<br>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<br>Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,<br>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,<br>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<br>The livelong day, with patient expectation,<br>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.<br>And when you saw his chariot but appear,<br>Have you not made an universal shout,<br>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks<br>To hear the replication of your sounds<br>Made in her concave shores?<br>And do you now put on your best attire?<br>And do you now cull out a holiday?<br>And do you now strew flowers in his way<br>That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?<br>Be gone!<br>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br>That needs must light on this ingratitude.
MARULLUS	1	1	7	9	3	22	Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?<br>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?—<br>You, sir, what trade are you?
MARULLUS	1	1	71	72	2	12	May we do so?<br>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
MESSALA	4	3	2114	2114	1	7	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
MESSALA	4	3	2116	2118	3	18	That by proscription and bills of outlawry,<br>Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus<br>Have put to death an hundred senators.
MESSALA	4	3	2123	2125	3	18	Cicero is dead,<br>And by that order of proscription.<br>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
MESSALA	4	3	2127	2127	1	8	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
MESSALA	4	3	2129	2129	1	4	That methinks is strange.
MESSALA	4	3	2131	2131	1	3	No, my lord.
MESSALA	4	3	2133	2134	2	18	Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,<br>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
MESSALA	4	3	2138	2138	1	8	Even so great men great losses should endure.
MESSALA	4	3	2193	2193	1	4	Good night, Lord Brutus.
MESSALA	5	1	2349	2349	1	4	What says my general?
MESSALA	5	1	2369	2369	1	3	Believe not so.
MESSALA	5	3	2470	2472	3	19	It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius<br>Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,<br>As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.
MESSALA	5	3	2474	2474	1	5	Where did you leave him?
MESSALA	5	3	2477	2477	1	9	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
MESSALA	5	3	2479	2479	1	4	Is not that he?
MESSALA	5	3	2488	2493	6	46	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.<br>O hateful error, melancholy’s child,<br>Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men<br>The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,<br>Thou never com’st unto a happy birth<br>But kill’st the mother that engendered thee!
MESSALA	5	3	2495	2500	6	42	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet<br>The noble Brutus, thrusting this report<br>Into his ears. I may say <span class="quote" data-words="2">thrusting it,</span><br>For piercing steel and darts envenomèd<br>Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus<br>As tidings of this sight.
MESSALA	5	3	2516	2516	1	6	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
MESSALA	5	5	2629	2629	1	8	My master’s man.—Strato, where is thy master?
MESSALA	5	5	2640	2640	1	5	How died my master, Strato?
MESSALA	5	5	2642	2643	2	15	Octavius, then take him to follow thee,<br>That did the latest service to my master.
MESSENGER-JC	5	1	2285	2288	4	24	Prepare you, generals.<br>The enemy comes on in gallant show.<br>Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,<br>And something to be done immediately.
METELLUS	2	1	739	744	6	47	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs<br>Will purchase us a good opinion<br>And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.<br>It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.<br>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,<br>But all be buried in his gravity.
METELLUS	2	1	815	817	3	23	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,<br>Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.<br>I wonder none of you have thought of him.
METELLUS	3	1	1189	1191	3	17	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,<br>Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat<br>An humble heart.
METELLUS	3	1	1207	1209	3	24	Is there no voice more worthy than my own<br>To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear<br>For the repealing of my banished brother?
METELLUS	3	1	1249	1250	2	10	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s<br>Should chance—
OCTAVIUS	3	1	1456	1456	1	4	I do, Mark Antony.
OCTAVIUS	3	1	1458	1460	3	20	He did receive his letters and is coming,<br>And bid me say to you by word of mouth—<br>O Caesar!
OCTAVIUS	3	1	1465	1465	1	8	He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
OCTAVIUS	3	2	1755	1755	1	7	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
OCTAVIUS	3	2	1757	1757	1	7	He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
OCTAVIUS	3	2	1761	1762	2	16	I heard him say Brutus and Cassius<br>Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1807	1807	1	8	Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1809	1809	1	4	Prick him down, Antony.
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1817	1817	1	6	Or here, or at the Capitol.
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1822	1824	3	20	So you thought him<br>And took his voice who should be pricked to die<br>In our black sentence and proscription.
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1835	1836	2	12	You may do your will,<br>But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.
OCTAVIUS	4	1	1856	1859	4	29	Let us do so, for we are at the stake<br>And bayed about with many enemies,<br>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,<br>Millions of mischiefs.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2273	2278	6	45	Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.<br>You said the enemy would not come down<br>But keep the hills and upper regions.<br>It proves not so; their battles are at hand.<br>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,<br>Answering before we do demand of them.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2291	2291	1	9	Upon the right hand, I; keep thou the left.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2293	2293	1	10	I do not cross you, but I will do so.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2296	2296	1	8	Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2299	2299	1	5	Stir not until the signal.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2301	2301	1	9	Not that we love words better, as you do.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2324	2330	7	58	Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,<br>The proof of it will turn to redder drops.<br>Look, I draw a sword against conspirators;<br>When think you that the sword goes up again?<br>Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds<br>Be well avenged, or till another Caesar<br>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2333	2334	2	12	So I hope.<br>I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.
OCTAVIUS	5	1	2340	2343	4	25	Come, Antony, away!—<br>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.<br>If you dare fight today, come to the field;<br>If not, when you have stomachs.
OCTAVIUS	5	5	2628	2628	1	4	What man is that?
OCTAVIUS	5	5	2636	2637	2	16	All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.—<br>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
OCTAVIUS	5	5	2639	2639	1	4	Do so, good Messala.
OCTAVIUS	5	5	2652	2657	6	46	According to his virtue, let us use him<br>With all respect and rites of burial.<br>Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,<br>Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.<br>So call the field to rest, and let’s away<br>To part the glories of this happy day.
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	1	1456	1456	1	4	I do, Mark Antony.
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	1	1458	1460	3	20	He did receive his letters and is coming,<br>And bid me say to you by word of mouth—<br>O Caesar!
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	1	1465	1465	1	8	He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	2	1755	1755	1	7	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	2	1757	1757	1	7	He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
OCTAVIUS_SERVANT	3	2	1761	1762	2	16	I heard him say Brutus and Cassius<br>Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
PINDARUS	4	2	1870	1872	3	20	I do not doubt<br>But that my noble master will appear<br>Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
PINDARUS	5	3	2423	2425	3	23	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off!<br>Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.<br>Fly therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
PINDARUS	5	3	2441	2441	1	3	O my lord!
PINDARUS	5	3	2443	2448	6	42	Titinius is enclosèd round about<br>With horsemen that make to him on the spur,<br>Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.<br>Now Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.<br>He’s ta’en.<br>And hark, they shout for joy.
PINDARUS	5	3	2466	2469	4	33	So I am free, yet would not so have been,<br>Durst I have done my will.—O Cassius!—<br>Far from this country Pindarus shall run,<br>Where never Roman shall take note of him.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1478	1478	1	8	We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1514	1514	1	3	None, Brutus, none.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1527	1527	1	4	Live, Brutus, live, live!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1547	1547	1	7	We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1558	1558	1	6	Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1628	1628	1	9	The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1637	1637	1	8	You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1643	1643	1	4	The will! The testament!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1650	1650	1	2	Come down.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1657	1657	1	5	Stand back! Room! Bear back!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1693	1694	2	12	Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!<br>Slay! Let not a traitor live!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1721	1721	1	2	We’ll mutiny.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1725	1725	1	7	Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1730	1730	1	10	Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will.
PLEBEIANS	3	2	1737	1737	1	2	Peace, ho!
POET-JC	4	3	2060	2062	3	20	Let me go in to see the Generals.<br>There is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet<br>They be alone.
POET-JC	4	3	2064	2064	1	6	Nothing but death shall stay me.
POET-JC	4	3	2066	2068	3	28	For shame, you generals, what do you mean?<br>Love and be friends as two such men should be,<br>For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1100	1102	3	21	I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House.<br>Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.<br>Why dost thou stay?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1104	1110	7	58	I would have had thee there and here again<br>Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.<br>O constancy, be strong upon my side;<br>Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue.<br>I have a man’s mind but a woman’s might.<br>How hard it is for women to keep counsel!—<br>Art thou here yet?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1114	1117	4	33	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,<br>For he went sickly forth. And take good note<br>What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.<br>Hark, boy, what noise is that?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1119	1121	3	19	Prithee, listen well.<br>I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,<br>And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1123	1123	1	8	Come hither, fellow. Which way hast thou been?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1125	1125	1	4	What is ’t o’clock?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1127	1127	1	7	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1130	1130	1	9	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1134	1135	2	8	Why, know’st thou any harms intended towards<br>him?
PORTIA-JC	2	1	1144	1153	10	72	I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing<br>The heart of woman is! O Brutus,<br>The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!<br>Sure the boy heard me. Brutus hath a<br>suit<br>That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow<br>faint.—<br>Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord.<br>Say I am merry. Come to me again<br>And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	836	836	1	3	Brutus, my lord.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	840	859	20	157	Nor for yours neither. You’ve ungently, Brutus,<br>Stole from my bed. And yesternight at supper<br>You suddenly arose and walked about,<br>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,<br>And when I asked you what the matter was,<br>You stared upon me with ungentle looks.<br>I urged you further; then you scratched your head<br>And too impatiently stamped with your foot.<br>Yet I insisted; yet you answered not,<br>But with an angry wafture of your hand<br>Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,<br>Fearing to strengthen that impatience<br>Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal<br>Hoping it was but an effect of humor,<br>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<br>It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,<br>And could it work so much upon your shape<br>As it hath much prevailed on your condition,<br>I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,<br>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	861	862	2	18	Brutus is wise and, were he not in health,<br>He would embrace the means to come by it.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	864	882	19	146	Is Brutus sick? And is it physical<br>To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors<br>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,<br>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed<br>To dare the vile contagion of the night<br>And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air<br>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,<br>You have some sick offense within your mind,<br>Which by the right and virtue of my place<br>I ought to know of. And upon my<br>knees<br>I charm you, by my once commended beauty,<br>By all your vows of love, and that great vow<br>Which did incorporate and make us one,<br>That you unfold to me, your self, your half,<br>Why you are heavy, and what men tonight<br>Have had resort to you; for here have been<br>Some six or seven who did hide their faces<br>Even from darkness.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	884	893	10	77	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<br>Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<br>Is it excepted I should know no secrets<br>That appertain to you? Am I your self<br>But, as it were, in sort or limitation,<br>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,<br>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the<br>suburbs<br>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,<br>Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.
PORTIA-JC	2	1	897	908	12	91	If this were true, then should I know this secret.<br>I grant I am a woman, but withal<br>A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.<br>I grant I am a woman, but withal<br>A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.<br>Think you I am no stronger than my sex,<br>Being so fathered and so husbanded?<br>Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em.<br>I have made strong proof of my constancy,<br>Giving myself a voluntary wound<br>Here, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience,<br>And not my husband’s secrets?
PUBLIUS-JC	2	2	1060	1060	1	3	Good morrow, Caesar.
PUBLIUS-JC	3	1	1164	1164	1	3	Sirrah, give place.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1487	1488	2	14	I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons<br>When severally we hear them renderèd.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1529	1529	1	7	Give him a statue with his ancestors.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1536	1536	1	4	Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1556	1556	1	8	Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1596	1597	2	12	If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br>Caesar has had great wrong.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1604	1604	1	10	Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1644	1645	2	9	They were villains, murderers. The<br>will! Read the will.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1651	1651	1	1	Descend.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1655	1655	1	6	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1688	1688	1	3	O noble Caesar!
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1692	1692	1	4	We will be revenged.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1697	1698	2	10	We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him,<br>we’ll die with him.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1734	1734	1	7	Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1748	1748	1	3	Go fetch fire.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1770	1770	1	4	Whither are you going?
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1774	1774	1	4	Answer every man directly.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1782	1784	3	22	That’s as much as to say they are<br>fools that marry. You’ll bear me a bang for that, I<br>fear. Proceed directly.
SECOND_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1788	1788	1	5	That matter is answered directly.
SECOND_SOLDIER_ANTONY	5	4	2554	2554	1	7	Room, ho! Tell Antony Brutus is ta’en.
SECOND_SOLDIER_BRUTUS	4	2	1898	1898	1	1	Stand!
SOOTHSAYER	1	2	101	101	1	5	Beware the ides of March.
SOOTHSAYER	1	2	108	108	1	5	Beware the ides of March.
SOOTHSAYER	1	2	95	95	1	1	Caesar.
SOOTHSAYER	2	1	1124	1124	1	6	At mine own house, good lady.
SOOTHSAYER	2	1	1126	1126	1	5	About the ninth hour, lady.
SOOTHSAYER	2	1	1128	1129	2	17	Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand<br>To see him pass on to the Capitol.
SOOTHSAYER	2	1	1131	1133	3	26	That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar<br>To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,<br>I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
SOOTHSAYER	2	1	1136	1143	8	61	None that I know will be, much that I fear may<br>chance.<br>Good morrow to you.—Here the street is narrow.<br>The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,<br>Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,<br>Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.<br>I’ll get me to a place more void, and there<br>Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
SOOTHSAYER	3	1	1155	1155	1	5	Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
STRATO	5	5	2624	2624	1	10	Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
STRATO	5	5	2630	2633	4	31	Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.<br>The conquerors can but make a fire of him,<br>For Brutus only overcame himself,<br>And no man else hath honor by his death.
STRATO	5	5	2638	2638	1	8	Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
STRATO	5	5	2641	2641	1	10	I held the sword, and he did run on it.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1489	1489	1	6	The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1530	1530	1	4	Let him be Caesar.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1546	1546	1	8	Let him go up into the public chair.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1550	1551	2	12	He says for Brutus’ sake<br>He finds himself beholding to us all.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1554	1555	2	12	Nay, that’s certain.<br>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1598	1599	2	13	Has he, masters?<br>I fear there will a worse come in his place.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1605	1605	1	9	There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1652	1652	1	4	You shall have leave.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1689	1689	1	3	O woeful day!
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1723	1723	1	6	Away then. Come, seek the conspirators.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1735	1735	1	3	O royal Caesar!
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	2	1749	1749	1	3	Pluck down benches.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1771	1771	1	4	Where do you dwell?
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1777	1777	1	6	Ay, and truly, you were best.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1791	1791	1	4	Your name, sir, truly.
THIRD_PLEBEIAN	3	3	1801	1804	4	27	Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho,<br>firebrands! To Brutus’, to Cassius’, burn all! Some<br>to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s, some to<br>Ligarius’. Away, go!
THIRD_SOLDIER_BRUTUS	4	2	1899	1899	1	1	Stand!
TITINIUS	4	3	2193	2193	1	4	Good night, Lord Brutus.
TITINIUS	5	3	2419	2422	4	30	O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,<br>Who, having some advantage on Octavius,<br>Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,<br>Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
TITINIUS	5	3	2428	2428	1	4	They are, my lord.
TITINIUS	5	3	2434	2434	1	9	I will be here again even with a thought.
TITINIUS	5	3	2473	2473	1	6	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
TITINIUS	5	3	2475	2476	2	9	All disconsolate,<br>With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
TITINIUS	5	3	2478	2478	1	9	He lies not like the living. O my heart!
TITINIUS	5	3	2480	2487	8	59	No, this was he, Messala,<br>But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,<br>As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,<br>So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set.<br>The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;<br>Clouds, dews, and dangers come. Our deeds are<br>done.<br>Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
TITINIUS	5	3	2494	2494	1	6	What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
TITINIUS	5	3	2501	2514	14	110	Hie you, Messala,<br>And I will seek for Pindarus the while.<br>Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?<br>Did I not meet thy friends, and did not they<br>Put on my brows this wreath of victory<br>And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their<br>shouts?<br>Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything.<br>But hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.<br>Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I<br>Will do his bidding.—Brutus, come apace,<br>And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.—<br>By your leave, gods, this is a Roman’s part.<br>Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart!
TREBONIUS	2	1	787	788	2	19	There is no fear in him. Let him not die,<br>For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
TREBONIUS	2	1	792	792	1	4	’Tis time to part.
TREBONIUS	2	2	1078	1079	2	20	Caesar, I will. And so near will I be<br>That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
TREBONIUS	3	1	1259	1261	3	18	Fled to his house amazed.<br>Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run<br>As it were doomsday.
VARRO	4	3	2202	2202	1	3	Calls my lord?
VARRO	4	3	2206	2207	2	10	So please you, we will stand and watch your<br>pleasure.
VARRO	4	3	2262	2262	1	2	My lord?
VARRO	4	3	2265	2265	1	4	Did we, my lord?
VARRO	4	3	2267	2267	1	6	No, my lord, I saw nothing.
VARRO	4	3	2272	2272	1	6	It shall be done, my lord.
VOLUMNIUS	5	5	2588	2588	1	4	What says my lord?
VOLUMNIUS	5	5	2594	2594	1	4	Not so, my lord.
VOLUMNIUS	5	5	2603	2603	1	9	That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.
