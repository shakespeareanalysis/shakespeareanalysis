ANTONIO-ADO	2	1	535	535	1	6	At a word, I am not.
ANTONIO-ADO	2	1	537	537	1	7	To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
ANTONIO-ADO	2	1	541	541	1	6	At a word, I am not.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	1	529	529	1	1	Amen.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	1	532	532	1	7	No more words. The clerk is answered.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	901	902	2	17	O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice<br>To slander music any more than once.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	906	909	4	31	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,<br>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit<br>To her he thinks not worthy, yet he woos,<br>Yet will he swear he loves.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	913	914	2	15	Note this before my notes:<br>There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	921	920	16	97	<span class="song" data-words="97">Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,<br>Men were deceivers ever,<br>One foot in sea and one on shore,<br>To one thing constant never.<br>Then sigh not so, but let them go,<br>And be you blithe and bonny,<br>Converting all your sounds of woe<br>Into Hey, nonny nonny.<br>Sing no more ditties, sing no mo,<br>Of dumps so dull and heavy.<br>The fraud of men was ever so,<br>Since summer first was leavy.<br>Then sigh not so, but let them go,<br>And be you blithe and bonny,<br>Converting all your sounds of woe<br>Into Hey, nonny nonny.</span>
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	938	938	1	6	And an ill singer, my lord.
BALTHASAR-ADO	2	3	950	950	1	6	The best I can, my lord.
BEATRICE	1	1	114	115	2	13	I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior<br>Benedick, nobody marks you.
BEATRICE	1	1	118	121	4	30	Is it possible disdain should die while she<br>hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?<br>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come<br>in her presence.
BEATRICE	1	1	126	130	5	46	A dear happiness to women. They would<br>else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I<br>thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor<br>for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow<br>than a man swear he loves me.
BEATRICE	1	1	134	135	2	14	Scratching could not make it worse an<br>’twere such a face as yours were.
BEATRICE	1	1	137	138	2	12	A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of<br>yours.
BEATRICE	1	1	142	143	2	12	You always end with a jade’s trick. I know<br>you of old.
BEATRICE	1	1	30	31	2	12	I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned<br>from the wars or no?
BEATRICE	1	1	38	44	7	59	He set up his bills here in Messina and<br>challenged Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s Fool,<br>reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid and<br>challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how<br>many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But<br>how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised to<br>eat all of his killing.
BEATRICE	1	1	49	51	3	22	You had musty victual, and he hath holp to<br>eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an<br>excellent stomach.
BEATRICE	1	1	53	54	2	14	And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he<br>to a lord?
BEATRICE	1	1	57	58	2	21	It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed<br>man, but for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.
BEATRICE	1	1	63	71	9	79	Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last<br>conflict, four of his five wits went halting off, and<br>now is the whole man governed with one, so that if<br>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him<br>bear it for a difference between himself and his<br>horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to<br>be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion<br>now? He hath every month a new sworn<br>brother.
BEATRICE	1	1	73	75	3	21	Very easily possible. He wears his faith but<br>as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the<br>next block.
BEATRICE	1	1	78	81	4	33	No. An he were, I would burn my study. But<br>I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no<br>young squarer now that will make a voyage with<br>him to the devil?
BEATRICE	1	1	84	88	5	45	O Lord, he will hang upon him like a<br>disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence,<br>and the taker runs presently mad. God help the<br>noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it<br>will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.
BEATRICE	1	1	90	90	1	3	Do, good friend.
BEATRICE	1	1	92	92	1	6	No, not till a hot January.
BEATRICE	2	1	426	427	2	17	How tartly that gentleman looks! I never<br>can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.
BEATRICE	2	1	429	433	5	37	He were an excellent man that were made<br>just in the midway between him and Benedick. The<br>one is too like an image and says nothing, and the<br>other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore<br>tattling.
BEATRICE	2	1	437	440	4	31	With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and<br>money enough in his purse, such a man would win<br>any woman in the world if he could get her<br>goodwill.
BEATRICE	2	1	444	446	4	33	Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen<br>God’s sending that way, for it is said <span class="quote" data-words="7">God sends acurst cow short horns,</span> but to a cow too curst, he<br>sends none.
BEATRICE	2	1	450	454	5	42	Just, if He send me no husband, for the<br>which blessing I am at Him upon my knees every<br>morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a<br>husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in<br>the woolen!
BEATRICE	2	1	457	464	8	80	What should I do with him? Dress him in my<br>apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman?<br>He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he<br>that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is<br>more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less<br>than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even<br>take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead<br>his apes into hell.
BEATRICE	2	1	466	471	7	70	No, but to the gate, and there will the devil<br>meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his<br>head, and say <span class="quote" data-words="15">Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get youto heaven; here’s no place for you maids.</span> So deliver<br>I up my apes and away to Saint Peter; for the<br>heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and<br>there live we as merry as the day is long.
BEATRICE	2	1	475	478	5	41	Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make<br>curtsy and say <span class="quote" data-words="5">Father, as it please you.</span> But yet for<br>all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or<br>else make another curtsy and say <span class="quote" data-words="5">Father, as itplease me.</span>
BEATRICE	2	1	482	487	6	60	Not till God make men of some other metal<br>than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be<br>overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make<br>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?<br>No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren,<br>and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
BEATRICE	2	1	491	501	11	102	The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you<br>be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too<br>important, tell him there is measure in everything,<br>and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero,<br>wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a<br>measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and<br>hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the<br>wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of<br>state and ancientry; and then comes repentance,<br>and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster<br>and faster till he sink into his grave.
BEATRICE	2	1	503	504	2	13	I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church<br>by daylight.
BEATRICE	2	1	546	546	1	9	Will you not tell me who told you so?
BEATRICE	2	1	548	548	1	9	Nor will you not tell me who you are?
BEATRICE	2	1	550	552	3	25	That I was disdainful, and that I had my<br>good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales! Well, this<br>was Signior Benedick that said so.
BEATRICE	2	1	554	554	1	8	I am sure you know him well enough.
BEATRICE	2	1	556	556	1	6	Did he never make you laugh?
BEATRICE	2	1	558	564	7	67	Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull<br>fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.<br>None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation<br>is not in his wit but in his villainy, for he<br>both pleases men and angers them, and then they<br>laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the<br>fleet.I would he had boarded me.
BEATRICE	2	1	567	572	6	48	Do, do. He’ll but break a comparison or two<br>on me, which peradventure not marked or not<br>laughed at strikes him into melancholy, and then<br>there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat<br>no supper that night. We must<br>follow the leaders.
BEATRICE	2	1	574	575	2	15	Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them<br>at the next turning.
BEATRICE	2	1	696	700	5	43	Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I<br>gave him use for it, a double heart for his single<br>one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false<br>dice. Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost<br>it.
BEATRICE	2	1	703	705	3	29	So I would not he should do me, my lord,<br>lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have<br>brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
BEATRICE	2	1	710	712	3	24	The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry,<br>nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and<br>something of that jealous complexion.
BEATRICE	2	1	722	722	1	5	Speak, count, ’tis your cue.
BEATRICE	2	1	727	728	2	18	Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his<br>mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither.
BEATRICE	2	1	730	732	3	29	Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on<br>the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear<br>that he is in her heart.
BEATRICE	2	1	734	736	3	28	Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone<br>to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a<br>corner and cry <span class="quote" data-words="4">Heigh-ho for a husband!</span>
BEATRICE	2	1	738	741	4	29	I would rather have one of your father’s<br>getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you?<br>Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could<br>come by them.
BEATRICE	2	1	743	746	4	37	No, my lord, unless I might have another for<br>working days. Your Grace is too costly to wear<br>every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me. I<br>was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
BEATRICE	2	1	750	752	3	25	No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then<br>there was a star danced, and under that was I<br>born.—Cousins, God give you joy!
BEATRICE	2	1	755	756	2	11	I cry you mercy, uncle.—By your Grace’s<br>pardon.
BEATRICE	2	3	1106	1107	2	13	Against my will, I am sent to bid you come<br>in to dinner.
BEATRICE	2	3	1109	1111	3	25	I took no more pains for those thanks than<br>you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I<br>would not have come.
BEATRICE	2	3	1113	1115	3	27	Yea, just so much as you may take upon a<br>knife’s point and choke a daw withal. You have no<br>stomach, signior. Fare you well.
BEATRICE	3	1	1235	1244	10	80	What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?<br>Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much?<br>Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adieu!<br>No glory lives behind the back of such.<br>And Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,<br>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.<br>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee<br>To bind our loves up in a holy band.<br>For others say thou dost deserve, and I<br>Believe it better than reportingly.
BEATRICE	3	4	1592	1592	1	4	Good morrow, sweet Hero.
BEATRICE	3	4	1594	1594	1	8	I am out of all other tune, methinks.
BEATRICE	3	4	1597	1599	3	21	You light o’ love with your heels! Then, if<br>your husband have stables enough, you’ll see he<br>shall lack no barns.
BEATRICE	3	4	1602	1604	3	18	’Tis almost five o’clock, cousin. ’Tis time<br>you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill.<br>Heigh-ho!
BEATRICE	3	4	1606	1606	1	8	For the letter that begins them all, H.
BEATRICE	3	4	1609	1609	1	5	What means the fool, trow?
BEATRICE	3	4	1614	1614	1	7	I am stuffed, cousin. I cannot smell.
BEATRICE	3	4	1617	1618	2	13	O, God help me, God help me! How long<br>have you professed apprehension?
BEATRICE	3	4	1621	1622	2	18	It is not seen enough; you should wear it in<br>your cap. By my troth, I am sick.
BEATRICE	3	4	1627	1628	2	10	<span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">Benedictus</span>! Why <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">benedictus</span>? You have some<br>moral in this <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="la">benedictus</span>?
BEATRICE	3	4	1642	1642	1	8	What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
BEATRICE	4	1	1825	1825	1	8	Why, how now, cousin, wherefore sink you down?
BEATRICE	4	1	1829	1830	2	12	Dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—<br>Hero, why Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
BEATRICE	4	1	1834	1834	1	6	How now, cousin Hero?
BEATRICE	4	1	1865	1865	1	8	O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
BEATRICE	4	1	1867	1868	2	14	No, truly not, although until last night<br>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
BEATRICE	4	1	1980	1980	1	8	Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
BEATRICE	4	1	1982	1982	1	8	You have no reason. I do it freely.
BEATRICE	4	1	1985	1986	2	13	Ah, how much might the man deserve of me<br>that would right her!
BEATRICE	4	1	1988	1988	1	8	A very even way, but no such friend.
BEATRICE	4	1	1990	1990	1	8	It is a man’s office, but not yours.
BEATRICE	4	1	1993	1997	5	45	As strange as the thing I know not. It were as<br>possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you,<br>but believe me not, and yet I lie not, I confess<br>nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my<br>cousin.
BEATRICE	4	1	1999	1999	1	6	Do not swear and eat it.
BEATRICE	4	1	2002	2002	1	6	Will you not eat your word?
BEATRICE	4	1	2005	2005	1	5	Why then, God forgive me.
BEATRICE	4	1	2007	2008	2	16	You have stayed me in a happy hour. I was<br>about to protest I loved you.
BEATRICE	4	1	2010	2011	2	15	I love you with so much of my heart that<br>none is left to protest.
BEATRICE	4	1	2013	2013	1	2	Kill Claudio.
BEATRICE	4	1	2015	2015	1	7	You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
BEATRICE	4	1	2017	2018	2	20	I am gone, though I am here. There is no<br>love in you. Nay, I pray you let me go.
BEATRICE	4	1	2020	2020	1	5	In faith, I will go.
BEATRICE	4	1	2022	2023	2	12	You dare easier be friends with me than<br>fight with mine enemy.
BEATRICE	4	1	2025	2031	7	57	Is he not approved in the height a villain<br>that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?<br>O, that I were a man! What, bear her in<br>hand until they come to take hands, and then, with<br>public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated<br>rancor—O God, that I were a man! I would eat his<br>heart in the marketplace.
BEATRICE	4	1	2033	2034	2	11	Talk with a man out at a window! A proper<br>saying.
BEATRICE	4	1	2036	2037	2	11	Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered,<br>she is undone.
BEATRICE	4	1	2039	2048	10	88	Princes and counties! Surely a princely testimony,<br>a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet<br>gallant, surely! O, that I were a man for his sake! Or<br>that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!<br>But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into<br>compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,<br>and trim ones, too. He is now as valiant as Hercules<br>that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man<br>with wishing; therefore I will die a woman with<br>grieving.
BEATRICE	4	1	2051	2052	2	12	Use it for my love some other way than<br>swearing by it.
BEATRICE	4	1	2055	2055	1	11	Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
BEATRICE	5	2	2542	2542	1	8	Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
BEATRICE	5	2	2544	2547	4	30	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Then</span> is spoken. Fare you well now. And<br>yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came, which is,<br>with knowing what hath passed between you and<br>Claudio.
BEATRICE	5	2	2550	2552	3	23	Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is<br>but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome. Therefore<br>I will depart unkissed.
BEATRICE	5	2	2560	2563	4	38	For them all together, which maintained so<br>politic a state of evil that they will not admit any<br>good part to intermingle with them. But for which<br>of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
BEATRICE	5	2	2566	2569	4	33	In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor<br>heart, if you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for<br>yours, for I will never love that which my friend<br>hates.
BEATRICE	5	2	2571	2573	3	17	It appears not in this confession. There’s not<br>one wise man among twenty that will praise<br>himself.
BEATRICE	5	2	2579	2579	1	7	And how long is that, think you?
BEATRICE	5	2	2588	2588	1	2	Very ill.
BEATRICE	5	2	2590	2590	1	3	Very ill, too.
BEATRICE	5	2	2598	2598	1	7	Will you go hear this news, signior?
BEATRICE	5	4	2709	2709	1	9	I answer to that name. What is your will?
BEATRICE	5	4	2711	2711	1	6	Why no, no more than reason.
BEATRICE	5	4	2714	2714	1	5	Do not you love me?
BEATRICE	5	4	2716	2717	2	16	Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula<br>Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
BEATRICE	5	4	2719	2719	1	9	They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
BEATRICE	5	4	2721	2721	1	6	No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
BEATRICE	5	4	2733	2735	3	30	I would not deny you, but by this good day, I<br>yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your<br>life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
BENEDICK	1	1	104	104	1	9	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
BENEDICK	1	1	111	113	3	24	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would<br>not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina,<br>as like him as she is.
BENEDICK	1	1	116	117	2	9	What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet<br>living?
BENEDICK	1	1	122	125	4	39	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain<br>I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and<br>I would I could find in my heart that I had not a<br>hard heart, for truly I love none.
BENEDICK	1	1	131	133	3	19	God keep your Ladyship still in that mind,<br>so some gentleman or other shall ’scape a predestinate<br>scratched face.
BENEDICK	1	1	136	136	1	6	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
BENEDICK	1	1	139	141	3	25	I would my horse had the speed of your<br>tongue and so good a continuer, but keep your<br>way, i’ God’s name, I have done.
BENEDICK	1	1	160	160	1	9	I noted her not, but I looked on her.
BENEDICK	1	1	162	165	4	32	Do you question me as an honest man<br>should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would<br>you have me speak after my custom, as being a<br>professed tyrant to their sex?
BENEDICK	1	1	167	172	6	54	Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a<br>high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too<br>little for a great praise. Only this commendation I<br>can afford her, that were she other than she is, she<br>were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is,<br>I do not like her.
BENEDICK	1	1	175	176	2	9	Would you buy her that you enquire after<br>her?
BENEDICK	1	1	178	182	5	50	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you<br>this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting<br>jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and<br>Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a<br>man take you to go in the song?
BENEDICK	1	1	185	190	6	51	I can see yet without spectacles, and I see<br>no such matter. There’s her cousin, an she were not<br>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in<br>beauty as the first of May doth the last of December.<br>But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have<br>you?
BENEDICK	1	1	193	199	7	61	Is ’t come to this? In faith, hath not the<br>world one man but he will wear his cap with<br>suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore<br>again? Go to, i’ faith, an thou wilt needs thrust<br>thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh<br>away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek<br>you.
BENEDICK	1	1	202	203	2	9	I would your Grace would constrain me to<br>tell.
BENEDICK	1	1	205	210	6	51	You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as<br>a dumb man, I would have you think so, but on my<br>allegiance—mark you this, on my allegiance—he<br>is in love. With who? Now, that is your Grace’s part.<br>Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s<br>short daughter.
BENEDICK	1	1	212	212	3	22	Like the old tale, my lord: <span class="quote" data-words="16">It is not so, nor’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be<br>so.</span>
BENEDICK	1	1	222	223	2	12	And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I<br>spoke mine.
BENEDICK	1	1	226	229	4	34	That I neither feel how she should be loved<br>nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion<br>that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the<br>stake.
BENEDICK	1	1	234	242	9	81	That a woman conceived me, I thank her;<br>that she brought me up, I likewise give her most<br>humble thanks. But that I will have a recheat<br>winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an<br>invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me.<br>Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust<br>any, I will do myself the right to trust none. And the<br>fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a<br>bachelor.
BENEDICK	1	1	244	249	6	53	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger,<br>my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more<br>blood with love than I will get again with drinking,<br>pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and<br>hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the<br>sign of blind Cupid.
BENEDICK	1	1	252	254	3	30	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and<br>shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped<br>on the shoulder and called Adam.
BENEDICK	1	1	257	260	6	57	The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible<br>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set<br>them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted,<br>and in such great letters as they write <span class="quote" data-words="6">Here is goodhorse to hire</span> let them signify under my sign <span class="quote" data-words="8">Hereyou may see Benedick the married man.</span>
BENEDICK	1	1	267	267	1	7	I look for an earthquake too, then.
BENEDICK	1	1	273	274	2	16	I have almost matter enough in me for such<br>an embassage, and so I commit you—
BENEDICK	1	1	279	283	5	39	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your<br>discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments,<br>and the guards are but slightly basted on neither.<br>Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your<br>conscience. And so I leave you.
BENEDICK	2	1	521	521	1	7	Well, I would you did like me.
BENEDICK	2	1	524	524	1	3	Which is one?
BENEDICK	2	1	526	527	2	10	I love you the better; the hearers may cry<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Amen.</span>
BENEDICK	2	1	547	547	1	5	No, you shall pardon me.
BENEDICK	2	1	549	549	1	2	Not now.
BENEDICK	2	1	553	553	1	2	What’s he?
BENEDICK	2	1	555	555	1	4	Not I, believe me.
BENEDICK	2	1	557	557	1	6	I pray you, what is he?
BENEDICK	2	1	565	566	2	11	When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him<br>what you say.
BENEDICK	2	1	573	573	1	4	In every good thing.
BENEDICK	2	1	604	604	1	2	Count Claudio?
BENEDICK	2	1	606	606	1	6	Come, will you go with me?
BENEDICK	2	1	608	613	6	46	Even to the next willow, about your own<br>business, county. What fashion will you wear the<br>garland of? About your neck like an usurer’s chain?<br>Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf? You<br>must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your<br>Hero.
BENEDICK	2	1	615	617	3	22	Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so<br>they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince<br>would have served you thus?
BENEDICK	2	1	619	621	3	20	Ho, now you strike like the blind man.<br>’Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat<br>the post.
BENEDICK	2	1	623	630	8	81	Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into<br>sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know<br>me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha, it may<br>be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but<br>so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed!<br>It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice<br>that puts the world into her person and so gives me<br>out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.
BENEDICK	2	1	633	640	8	76	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of<br>Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a<br>lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him<br>true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this<br>young lady, and I offered him my company to a<br>willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being<br>forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to<br>be whipped.
BENEDICK	2	1	642	644	3	22	The flat transgression of a schoolboy who,<br>being overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it<br>his companion, and he steals it.
BENEDICK	2	1	647	651	5	42	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been<br>made, and the garland too, for the garland he<br>might have worn himself, and the rod he might<br>have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen<br>his bird’s nest.
BENEDICK	2	1	654	655	2	12	If their singing answer your saying, by my<br>faith, you say honestly.
BENEDICK	2	1	659	680	22	211	O, she misused me past the endurance of a<br>block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would<br>have answered her. My very visor began to assume<br>life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I<br>had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I<br>was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest<br>with such impossible conveyance upon me that I<br>stood like a man at a mark with a whole army<br>shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every<br>word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her<br>terminations, there were no living near her; she<br>would infect to the North Star. I would not marry<br>her though she were endowed with all that Adam<br>had left him before he transgressed. She would have<br>made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft<br>his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her.<br>You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I<br>would to God some scholar would conjure her, for<br>certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet<br>in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon<br>purpose because they would go thither. So indeed<br>all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.
BENEDICK	2	1	682	690	9	82	Will your Grace command me any service<br>to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand<br>now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send<br>me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the<br>furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester<br>John’s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s<br>beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather<br>than hold three words’ conference with this harpy.<br>You have no employment for me?
BENEDICK	2	1	692	693	2	17	O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not! I cannot<br>endure my Lady Tongue.
BENEDICK	2	3	1080	1105	26	259	This can be no trick. The<br>conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of<br>this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems<br>her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it<br>must be requited! I hear how I am censured. They<br>say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love<br>come from her. They say, too, that she will rather<br>die than give any sign of affection. I did never think<br>to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they<br>that hear their detractions and can put them to<br>mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can<br>bear them witness. And virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot<br>reprove it. And wise, but for loving me; by my troth,<br>it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of<br>her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her! I<br>may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of<br>wit broken on me because I have railed so long<br>against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A<br>man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot<br>endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and<br>these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the<br>career of his humor? No! The world must be peopled.<br>When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not<br>think I should live till I were married. Here comes<br>Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy some<br>marks of love in her.
BENEDICK	2	3	1108	1108	1	8	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
BENEDICK	2	3	1112	1112	1	7	You take pleasure then in the message?
BENEDICK	2	3	1116	1119	7	81	Ha! <span class="quote" data-words="13">Against my will I am sent to bid youcome in to dinner.</span> There’s a double meaning in<br>that. <span class="quote" data-words="15">I took no more pains for those thanks thanyou took pains to thank me.</span> That’s as much as to<br>say <span class="quote" data-words="12">Any pains that I take for you is as easy asthanks.</span> If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I<br>do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
BENEDICK	2	3	858	858	1	1	Boy!
BENEDICK	2	3	860	861	2	15	In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it<br>hither to me in the orchard.
BENEDICK	2	3	863	893	31	312	I know that, but I would have thee hence<br>and here again.<br>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much<br>another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors<br>to love, will, after he hath laughed at such<br>shallow follies in others, become the argument of<br>his own scorn by falling in love—and such a man is<br>Claudio. I have known when there was no music<br>with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he<br>rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known<br>when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a<br>good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake<br>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont<br>to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest<br>man and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography;<br>his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so<br>many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see<br>with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not<br>be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster,<br>but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an<br>oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool.<br>One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet<br>I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all<br>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not<br>come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain;<br>wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen<br>her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not<br>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good<br>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall<br>be of what color it please God. Ha! The Prince and<br>Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbor.
BENEDICK	2	3	917	920	4	31	Now, divine air! Now is his soul<br>ravished. Is it not strange that sheeps’ guts should<br>hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well, a horn for my<br>money, when all’s done.
BENEDICK	2	3	941	945	5	43	An he had been a dog that should<br>have howled thus, they would have hanged him. And<br>I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as<br>lief have heard the night raven, come what plague<br>could have come after it.
BENEDICK	2	3	962	963	2	9	Is ’t possible? Sits the wind in that<br>corner?
BENEDICK	2	3	983	985	3	21	I should think this a gull but that the<br>white-bearded fellow speaks it. Knavery cannot,<br>sure, hide himself in such reverence.
BENEDICK	3	2	1259	1259	1	8	Gallants, I am not as I have been.
BENEDICK	3	2	1265	1265	1	4	I have the toothache.
BENEDICK	3	2	1267	1267	1	2	Hang it!
BENEDICK	3	2	1271	1272	2	11	Well, everyone can master a grief but he<br>that has it.
BENEDICK	3	2	1309	1312	4	32	Yet is this no charm for the toothache.—<br>Old signior, walk aside with me. I have studied eight<br>or nine wise words to speak to you, which these<br>hobby-horses must not hear.
BENEDICK	4	1	1731	1732	2	13	How now, interjections? Why, then, some<br>be of laughing, as ah, ha, he!
BENEDICK	4	1	1781	1781	1	6	This looks not like a nuptial.
BENEDICK	4	1	1828	1828	1	4	How doth the lady?
BENEDICK	4	1	1862	1864	3	19	Sir, sir, be patient.<br>For my part, I am so attired in wonder<br>I know not what to say.
BENEDICK	4	1	1866	1866	1	7	Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
BENEDICK	4	1	1906	1909	4	33	Two of them have the very bent of honor,<br>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br>The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,<br>Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.
BENEDICK	4	1	1965	1970	6	43	Signior Leonato, let the Friar advise you.<br>And though you know my inwardness and love<br>Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,<br>Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this<br>As secretly and justly as your soul<br>Should with your body.
BENEDICK	4	1	1979	1979	1	8	Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
BENEDICK	4	1	1981	1981	1	5	I will not desire that.
BENEDICK	4	1	1983	1984	2	9	Surely I do believe your fair cousin is<br>wronged.
BENEDICK	4	1	1987	1987	1	8	Is there any way to show such friendship?
BENEDICK	4	1	1989	1989	1	5	May a man do it?
BENEDICK	4	1	1991	1992	2	15	I do love nothing in the world so well as<br>you. Is not that strange?
BENEDICK	4	1	1998	1998	1	7	By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me!
BENEDICK	4	1	2000	2001	2	22	I will swear by it that you love me, and I will<br>make him eat it that says I love not you.
BENEDICK	4	1	2003	2004	2	14	With no sauce that can be devised to it. I<br>protest I love thee.
BENEDICK	4	1	2006	2006	1	4	What offense, sweet Beatrice?
BENEDICK	4	1	2009	2009	1	7	And do it with all thy heart.
BENEDICK	4	1	2012	2012	1	7	Come, bid me do anything for thee.
BENEDICK	4	1	2014	2014	1	6	Ha! Not for the wide world.
BENEDICK	4	1	2016	2016	1	3	Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
BENEDICK	4	1	2019	2019	1	1	Beatrice—
BENEDICK	4	1	2021	2021	1	4	We’ll be friends first.
BENEDICK	4	1	2024	2024	1	4	Is Claudio thine enemy?
BENEDICK	4	1	2032	2032	1	3	Hear me, Beatrice—
BENEDICK	4	1	2035	2035	1	3	Nay, but Beatrice—
BENEDICK	4	1	2038	2038	1	1	Beat—
BENEDICK	4	1	2049	2050	2	9	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love<br>thee.
BENEDICK	4	1	2053	2054	2	11	Think you in your soul the Count Claudio<br>hath wronged Hero?
BENEDICK	4	1	2056	2060	5	50	Enough, I am engaged. I will challenge<br>him. I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By<br>this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.<br>As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your<br>cousin. I must say she is dead, and so farewell.
BENEDICK	5	1	2274	2274	1	4	Good day, my lord.
BENEDICK	5	1	2282	2283	2	15	In a false quarrel there is no true valor. I<br>came to seek you both.
BENEDICK	5	1	2287	2287	1	9	It is in my scabbard. Shall I draw it?
BENEDICK	5	1	2297	2299	3	21	Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an<br>you charge it against me. I pray you, choose another<br>subject.
BENEDICK	5	1	2305	2305	1	8	Shall I speak a word in your ear?
BENEDICK	5	1	2307	2312	6	51	You are a villain. I jest<br>not. I will make it good how you dare, with what you<br>dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will<br>protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet<br>lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me<br>hear from you.
BENEDICK	5	1	2320	2320	1	8	Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
BENEDICK	5	1	2346	2354	9	80	Fare you well, boy. You know my mind. I<br>will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You<br>break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God<br>be thanked, hurt not.—My lord, for your many<br>courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your<br>company. Your brother the Bastard is fled from<br>Messina. You have among you killed a sweet and<br>innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and<br>I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.
BENEDICK	5	2	2499	2501	3	18	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve<br>well at my hands by helping me to the speech of<br>Beatrice.
BENEDICK	5	2	2504	2506	3	22	In so high a style, Margaret, that no man<br>living shall come over it, for in most comely truth<br>thou deservest it.
BENEDICK	5	2	2509	2510	2	11	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s<br>mouth; it catches.
BENEDICK	5	2	2513	2515	3	23	A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt<br>a woman. And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give<br>thee the bucklers.
BENEDICK	5	2	2518	2520	3	21	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in<br>the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous<br>weapons for maids.
BENEDICK	5	2	2523	2537	19	144	And therefore will come.<span class="song" data-words="17">The god of love<br>That sits above,<br>And knows me, and knows me,<br>How pitiful I deserve—</span><br>I mean in singing. But in loving, Leander the good<br>swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and<br>a whole book full of these quondam carpetmongers,<br>whose names yet run smoothly in the even<br>road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly<br>turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry,<br>I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out<br>no rhyme to <span class="quote" data-words="1">lady</span> but <span class="quote" data-words="1">baby</span>—an innocent<br>rhyme; for <span class="quote" data-words="1">scorn,</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">horn</span>—a hard rhyme; for<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">school,</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">fool</span>—a babbling rhyme; very ominous<br>endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming<br>planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.<br>Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called<br>thee?
BENEDICK	5	2	2543	2543	1	5	O, stay but till then!
BENEDICK	5	2	2548	2549	2	9	Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss<br>thee.
BENEDICK	5	2	2553	2559	7	61	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right<br>sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee<br>plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either<br>I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe<br>him a coward. And I pray thee now tell me, for<br>which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love<br>with me?
BENEDICK	5	2	2564	2565	2	17	Suffer love! A good epithet. I do suffer love<br>indeed, for I love thee against my will.
BENEDICK	5	2	2570	2570	1	9	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
BENEDICK	5	2	2574	2578	5	44	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived<br>in the time of good neighbors. If a man do not erect<br>in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no<br>longer in monument than the bell rings and the<br>widow weeps.
BENEDICK	5	2	2580	2587	8	64	Question: why, an hour in clamor and a<br>quarter in rheum. Therefore is it most expedient for<br>the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no<br>impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of<br>his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for<br>praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is<br>praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your<br>cousin?
BENEDICK	5	2	2589	2589	1	4	And how do you?
BENEDICK	5	2	2591	2592	2	18	Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I<br>leave you too, for here comes one in haste.
BENEDICK	5	2	2599	2601	3	26	I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be<br>buried in thy eyes—and, moreover, I will go with<br>thee to thy uncle’s.
BENEDICK	5	4	2642	2643	2	18	And so am I, being else by faith enforced<br>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
BENEDICK	5	4	2652	2652	1	8	Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
BENEDICK	5	4	2654	2656	3	25	To bind me, or undo me, one of them.—<br>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,<br>Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.
BENEDICK	5	4	2658	2658	1	10	And I do with an eye of love requite her.
BENEDICK	5	4	2661	2665	5	38	Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.<br>But for my will, my will is your goodwill<br>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoined<br>In the state of honorable marriage—<br>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
BENEDICK	5	4	2683	2686	4	35	Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,<br>And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow<br>And got a calf in that same noble feat<br>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
BENEDICK	5	4	2708	2708	1	7	Soft and fair, friar.—Which is Beatrice?
BENEDICK	5	4	2710	2710	1	5	Do not you love me?
BENEDICK	5	4	2712	2713	2	16	Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio<br>Have been deceived. They swore you did.
BENEDICK	5	4	2715	2715	1	6	Troth, no, no more than reason.
BENEDICK	5	4	2718	2718	1	9	They swore that you were almost sick for me.
BENEDICK	5	4	2720	2720	1	10	’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
BENEDICK	5	4	2730	2732	3	23	A miracle! Here’s our own hands against<br>our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light<br>I take thee for pity.
BENEDICK	5	4	2736	2736	1	6	Peace! I will stop your mouth.
BENEDICK	5	4	2738	2749	12	116	I’ll tell thee what, prince: a college of<br>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor.<br>Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?<br>No. If a man will be beaten with brains, he shall<br>wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I<br>do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any<br>purpose that the world can say against it, and<br>therefore never flout at me for what I have said<br>against it. For man is a giddy thing, and this is my<br>conclusion.—For thy part, Claudio, I did think to<br>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my<br>kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.
BENEDICK	5	4	2755	2757	3	24	Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a<br>dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our<br>own hearts and our wives’ heels.
BENEDICK	5	4	2759	2762	4	30	First, of my word! Therefore play, music.—<br>Prince, thou art sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.<br>There is no staff more reverend than one tipped<br>with horn.
BENEDICK	5	4	2765	2767	3	16	Think not on him till tomorrow.<br>I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him.—Strike<br>up, pipers!
BORACHIO	1	3	391	394	4	26	I came yonder from a great supper. The<br>Prince your brother is royally entertained by<br>Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an<br>intended marriage.
BORACHIO	1	3	398	398	1	7	Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.
BORACHIO	1	3	400	400	1	2	Even he.
BORACHIO	1	3	403	404	2	9	Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of<br>Leonato.
BORACHIO	1	3	407	413	7	53	Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was<br>smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and<br>Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I<br>whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it<br>agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for<br>himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count<br>Claudio.
BORACHIO	1	3	423	423	1	5	We’ll wait upon your Lordship.
BORACHIO	2	1	580	581	2	10	And that is Claudio. I know him by his<br>bearing.
BORACHIO	2	1	590	591	2	12	So did I too, and he swore he would marry<br>her tonight.
BORACHIO	2	2	804	804	1	8	Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
BORACHIO	2	2	810	811	2	14	Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that<br>no dishonesty shall appear in me.
BORACHIO	2	2	813	815	3	23	I think I told your Lordship a year since,<br>how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the<br>waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
BORACHIO	2	2	817	819	3	19	I can, at any unseasonable instant of the<br>night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber<br>window.
BORACHIO	2	2	822	827	6	48	The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go<br>you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell<br>him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying<br>the renowned Claudio, whose estimation do you<br>mightily hold up, to a contaminated stale, such a<br>one as Hero.
BORACHIO	2	2	829	831	3	21	Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex<br>Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you<br>for any other issue?
BORACHIO	2	2	834	850	17	153	Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don<br>Pedro and the Count Claudio alone. Tell them that<br>you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal<br>both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your<br>brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his<br>friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened<br>with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered<br>thus. They will scarcely believe this without<br>trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less<br>likelihood than to see me at her chamber window,<br>hear me call Margaret <span class="quote" data-words="1">Hero,</span> hear Margaret term<br>me <span class="quote" data-words="1">Claudio,</span> and bring them to see this the very<br>night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime<br>I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be<br>absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth<br>of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called<br>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
BORACHIO	2	2	854	855	2	13	Be you constant in the accusation, and my<br>cunning shall not shame me.
BORACHIO	3	3	1465	1465	1	2	What, Conrade!
BORACHIO	3	3	1467	1467	1	3	Conrade, I say!
BORACHIO	3	3	1469	1470	2	12	Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there<br>would a scab follow.
BORACHIO	3	3	1473	1475	3	22	Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse,<br>for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true<br>drunkard, utter all to thee.
BORACHIO	3	3	1478	1479	2	11	Therefore know, I have earned of Don<br>John a thousand ducats.
BORACHIO	3	3	1482	1485	4	31	Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible<br>any villainy should be so rich. For when rich<br>villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may<br>make what price they will.
BORACHIO	3	3	1487	1489	3	24	That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou<br>knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a<br>cloak, is nothing to a man.
BORACHIO	3	3	1491	1491	1	4	I mean the fashion.
BORACHIO	3	3	1493	1495	3	21	Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.<br>But seest thou not what a deformed thief this<br>fashion is?
BORACHIO	3	3	1499	1499	1	5	Didst thou not hear somebody?
BORACHIO	3	3	1501	1509	9	64	Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief<br>this fashion is, how giddily he turns about all the<br>hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty,<br>sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers<br>in the reechy painting, sometimes like god Bel’s<br>priests in the old church window, sometimes like<br>the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten<br>tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his<br>club?
BORACHIO	3	3	1515	1523	9	72	Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight<br>wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman,<br>by the name of Hero. She leans me out at<br>her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand<br>times goodnight. I tell this tale vilely. I should first<br>tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master,<br>planted and placed and possessed by my master<br>Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable<br>amiable encounter.
BORACHIO	3	3	1525	1535	11	89	Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio,<br>but the devil my master knew she was Margaret;<br>and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them,<br>partly by the dark night, which did deceive them,<br>but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any<br>slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio<br>enraged, swore he would meet her as he was<br>appointed next morning at the temple, and there,<br>before the whole congregation, shame her with<br>what he saw o’ernight and send her home again<br>without a husband.
BORACHIO	3	3	1549	1550	2	15	We are like to prove a goodly<br>commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills.
BORACHIO	4	2	2072	2072	1	1	Borachio.
BORACHIO	4	2	2079	2079	1	4	Yea, sir, we hope.
BORACHIO	4	2	2091	2091	1	8	Sir, I say to you we are none.
BORACHIO	4	2	2105	2105	1	2	Master constable—
BORACHIO	5	1	2389	2403	15	128	Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine<br>answer. Do you hear me, and let this count kill me.<br>I have deceived even your very eyes. What your<br>wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools<br>have brought to light, who in the night overheard<br>me confessing to this man how Don John your<br>brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how<br>you were brought into the orchard and saw me<br>court Margaret in Hero’s garments, how you disgraced<br>her when you should marry her. My villainy<br>they have upon record, which I had rather seal with<br>my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is<br>dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation.<br>And, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a<br>villain.
BORACHIO	5	1	2407	2408	2	10	Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of<br>it.
BORACHIO	5	1	2422	2422	1	9	If you would know your wronger, look on me.
BORACHIO	5	1	2425	2425	1	4	Yea, even I alone.
BORACHIO	5	1	2464	2467	4	33	No, by my soul, she was not,<br>Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,<br>But always hath been just and virtuous<br>In anything that I do know by her.
BOY-ADO	2	3	859	859	1	1	Signior?
BOY-ADO	2	3	862	862	1	5	I am here already, sir.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	158	159	2	9	Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of<br>Signior Leonato?
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	161	161	1	7	Is she not a modest young lady?
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	166	166	1	8	No, I pray thee, speak in sober judgment.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	173	174	2	16	Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell<br>me truly how thou lik’st her.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	177	177	1	7	Can the world buy such a jewel?
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	183	184	2	13	In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever<br>I looked on.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	191	192	2	17	I would scarce trust myself, though I had<br>sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	211	211	1	8	If this were so, so were it uttered.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	215	216	2	12	If my passion change not shortly, God forbid<br>it should be otherwise.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	219	219	1	9	You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	221	221	1	8	And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	224	224	1	6	That I love her, I feel.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	232	233	2	13	And never could maintain his part but in the<br>force of his will.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	263	264	2	9	If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be<br>horn-mad.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	275	276	2	12	To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had<br>it—
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	284	284	1	9	My liege, your Highness now may do me good.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	288	288	1	6	Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	291	300	10	77	O, my lord,<br>When you went onward on this ended action,<br>I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,<br>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand<br>Than to drive liking to the name of love.<br>But now I am returned and that war thoughts<br>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms<br>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<br>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,<br>Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.
CLAUDIO-ADO	1	1	307	310	4	31	How sweetly you do minister to love,<br>That know love’s grief by his complexion!<br>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,<br>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	583	583	1	7	You know me well. I am he.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	588	588	1	6	How know you he loves her?
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	593	603	11	85	Thus answer I in name of Benedick,<br>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.<br>’Tis certain so. The Prince woos for himself.<br>Friendship is constant in all other things<br>Save in the office and affairs of love.<br>Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.<br>Let every eye negotiate for itself<br>And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch<br>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.<br>This is an accident of hourly proof,<br>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore, Hero.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	605	605	1	3	Yea, the same.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	607	607	1	1	Whither?
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	614	614	1	6	I wish him joy of her.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	618	618	1	5	I pray you, leave me.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	622	622	1	10	If it will not be, I’ll leave you.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	707	707	1	4	Not sad, my lord.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	709	709	1	3	Neither, my lord.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	723	726	4	37	Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were<br>but little happy if I could say how much.—Lady, as<br>you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you<br>and dote upon the exchange.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	733	733	1	5	And so she doth, cousin.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	771	772	2	13	Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches<br>till love have all his rites.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	1	787	787	1	4	And I, my lord.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1004	1004	1	1	That.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1011	1013	3	24	Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps,<br>sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses:<br><span class="quote" data-words="7">O sweet Benedick, God give me patience!</span>
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1020	1021	2	17	To what end? He would make but a sport of it<br>and torment the poor lady worse.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1025	1025	1	5	And she is exceeding wise.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1036	1040	5	46	Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says<br>she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere<br>she make her love known, and she will die if he woo<br>her rather than she will bate one breath of her<br>accustomed crossness.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1044	1044	1	6	He is a very proper man.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1046	1046	1	8	Before God, and in my mind, very wise.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1049	1049	1	7	And I take him to be valiant.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1061	1062	2	13	Never tell him, my lord, let her wear it out<br>with good counsel.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	1070	1072	3	15	If he do not<br>dote on her upon this, I will never trust my<br>expectation.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	895	896	2	16	Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,<br>As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	898	899	2	15	O, very well my lord. The music ended,<br>We’ll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	955	957	3	23	O, ay. Stalk on, stalk on; the<br>fowl sits.—I did never think that lady would have<br>loved any man.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	968	968	1	3	Faith, like enough.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	973	974	2	8	Bait the hook well; this fish<br>will bite.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	977	977	1	3	She did indeed.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	986	987	2	8	He hath ta’en th’ infection.<br>Hold it up.
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	992	992	3	26	’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. <span class="quote" data-words="2">ShallI,</span> says she, <span class="quote" data-words="15">that have so oft encountered him withscorn, write to him that I love him?</span>
CLAUDIO-ADO	2	3	999	1000	2	18	Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember<br>a pretty jest your daughter told us of.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1247	1248	2	10	I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe<br>me.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1261	1261	1	6	I hope he be in love.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1268	1268	1	9	You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1273	1273	1	7	Yet say I, he is in love.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1282	1284	3	25	If he be not in love with some woman, there<br>is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o’<br>mornings. What should that bode?
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1286	1288	3	22	No, but the barber’s man hath been seen<br>with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath<br>already stuffed tennis balls.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1293	1294	2	11	That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in<br>love.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1296	1296	1	9	And when was he wont to wash his face?
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1299	1300	2	18	Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept<br>into a lute string and now governed by stops—
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1303	1303	1	7	Nay, but I know who loves him.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1306	1307	2	13	Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of<br>all, dies for him.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1314	1316	3	27	’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this<br>played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two<br>bears will not bite one another when they meet.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1330	1331	2	10	If there be any impediment, I pray you discover<br>it.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1342	1342	1	2	Who, Hero?
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1345	1345	1	1	Disloyal?
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1354	1354	1	4	May this be so?
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1360	1362	3	24	If I see anything tonight why I should not<br>marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I<br>should wed, there will I shame her.
CLAUDIO-ADO	3	2	1369	1369	1	4	O mischief strangely thwarting!
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1716	1716	1	1	No.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1725	1725	1	4	Know you any, Hero?
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1729	1730	2	18	O, what men dare do! What men may do!<br>What men daily do, not knowing what they do!
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1733	1735	3	21	Stand thee by, friar.—Father, by your leave,<br>Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul<br>Give me this maid, your daughter?
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1737	1738	2	17	And what have I to give you back whose worth<br>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1740	1752	13	98	Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.—<br>There, Leonato, take her back again.<br>Give not this rotten orange to your friend.<br>She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.<br>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br>O, what authority and show of truth<br>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br>Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br>All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br>By these exterior shows? But she is none.<br>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.<br>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1754	1755	2	13	Not to be married,<br>Not to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1759	1765	7	50	I know what you would say: if I have known her,<br>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<br>And so extenuate the forehand sin.<br>No, Leonato,<br>I never tempted her with word too large,<br>But, as a brother to his sister, showed<br>Bashful sincerity and comely love.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1767	1772	6	47	Out on thee, seeming! I will write against it.<br>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.<br>But you are more intemperate in your blood<br>Than Venus, or those pampered animals<br>That rage in savage sensuality.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1783	1785	3	22	Leonato, stand I here?<br>Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?<br>Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1787	1789	3	25	Let me but move one question to your daughter,<br>And by that fatherly and kindly power<br>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1793	1793	1	8	To make you answer truly to your name.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1796	1800	5	36	Marry, that can Hero!<br>Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.<br>What man was he talked with you yesternight<br>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
CLAUDIO-ADO	4	1	1815	1823	9	71	O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been<br>If half thy outward graces had been placed<br>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair. Farewell,<br>Thou pure impiety and impious purity.<br>For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love<br>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>And never shall it more be gracious.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2198	2198	1	6	Good day to both of you.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2207	2207	1	3	Who wrongs him?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2211	2213	3	23	Marry, beshrew my hand<br>If it should give your age such cause of fear.<br>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2229	2229	1	2	My villainy?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2236	2236	1	9	Away! I will not have to do with you.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2273	2273	1	4	Now, signior, what news?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2277	2278	2	17	We had liketo have had our two noses<br>snapped off with two old men without teeth.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2284	2286	3	26	We have been up and down to seek thee, for<br>we are high-proof melancholy and would fain have<br>it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2289	2291	3	26	Never any did so, though very many have<br>been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do<br>the minstrels: draw to pleasure us.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2294	2296	3	18	What, courage, man! What<br>though care killed a cat? Thou hast mettle enough<br>in thee to kill care.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2300	2301	2	11	Nay, then, give him another staff.<br>This last was broke ’cross.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2304	2304	1	10	If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2306	2306	1	6	God bless me from a challenge!
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2313	2314	2	11	Well, I will meet you, so I may have good<br>cheer.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2316	2319	4	36	I’ faith, I thank him. He hath bid me to a<br>calf’s head and a capon, the which if I do not carve<br>most curiously, say my knife’s naught. Shall I not<br>find a woodcock too?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2335	2336	2	11	For the which she wept heartily and said she<br>cared not.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2340	2341	2	14	All, all. And, moreover, God saw him when<br>he was hid in the garden.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2344	2344	2	10	Yea, and text underneath: <span class="quote" data-words="6">Here dwells Benedick,the married man</span>?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2356	2357	2	13	In most profound earnest, and, I’ll warrant<br>you, for the love of Beatrice.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2359	2359	1	2	Most sincerely.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2362	2363	2	19	He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape<br>a doctor to such a man.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2372	2372	1	6	Hearken after their offense, my lord.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2383	2384	2	16	Rightly reasoned, and in his own division;<br>and, by my troth, there’s one meaning well suited.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2405	2405	1	8	I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2411	2412	2	16	Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear<br>In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2432	2436	5	35	I know not how to pray your patience,<br>Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself.<br>Impose me to what penance your invention<br>Can lay upon my sin. Yet sinned I not<br>But in mistaking.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2455	2458	4	22	O, noble sir!<br>Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.<br>I do embrace your offer and dispose<br>For henceforth of poor Claudio.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	1	2495	2495	1	5	Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	3	2602	2602	1	6	Is this the monument of Leonato?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	3	2604	2606	9	62	<span class="poem" data-words="37">Done to death by slanderous tongues<br>Was the Hero that here lies.<br>Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,<br>Gives her fame which never dies.<br>So the life that died with shame<br>Lives in death with glorious fame.</span>Hang thou there upon the tomb,<br>Praising her when I am dumb.<br>Now music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	3	2623	2624	2	11	Now, unto thy bones, goodnight.<br>Yearly will I do this rite.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	3	2630	2630	1	7	Good morrow, masters. Each his several way.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	3	2633	2634	2	17	And Hymen now with luckier issue speed ’s,<br>Than this for whom we rendered up this woe.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2673	2673	1	8	I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2678	2682	5	41	I think he thinks upon the savage bull.<br>Tush, fear not, man. We’ll tip thy horns with gold,<br>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,<br>As once Europa did at lusty Jove<br>When he would play the noble beast in love.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2687	2688	2	27	For this I owe you. Here comes other reck’nings.<br>Which is the lady I must seize upon?
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2690	2690	1	10	Why, then, she’s mine.—Sweet, let me see your face.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2693	2694	2	20	Give me your hand before this holy friar.<br>I am your husband, if you like of me.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2697	2697	1	2	Another Hero!
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2723	2726	4	29	And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her,<br>For here’s a paper written in his hand,<br>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,<br>Fashioned to Beatrice.
CLAUDIO-ADO	5	4	2750	2754	5	42	I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied<br>Beatrice, that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy<br>single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out<br>of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look<br>exceeding narrowly to thee.
CONRADE	1	3	352	353	2	13	What the goodyear, my lord, why are you<br>thus out of measure sad?
CONRADE	1	3	356	356	1	4	You should hear reason.
CONRADE	1	3	359	360	2	10	If not a present remedy, at least a patient<br>sufferance.
CONRADE	1	3	369	375	7	66	Yea, but you must not make the full show of<br>this till you may do it without controlment. You<br>have of late stood out against your brother, and he<br>hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is<br>impossible you should take true root but by the fair<br>weather that you make yourself. It is needful that<br>you frame the season for your own harvest.
CONRADE	1	3	387	387	1	8	Can you make no use of your discontent?
CONRADE	1	3	419	419	1	5	To the death, my lord.
CONRADE	3	3	1468	1468	1	7	Here, man, I am at thy elbow.
CONRADE	3	3	1471	1472	2	14	I will owe thee an answer for that. And now<br>forward with thy tale.
CONRADE	3	3	1480	1481	2	10	Is it possible that any villainy should be so<br>dear?
CONRADE	3	3	1486	1486	1	4	I wonder at it.
CONRADE	3	3	1490	1490	1	4	Yes, it is apparel.
CONRADE	3	3	1492	1492	1	6	Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
CONRADE	3	3	1500	1500	1	7	No, ’twas the vane on the house.
CONRADE	3	3	1510	1514	5	41	All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears<br>out more apparel than the man. But art not thou<br>thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast<br>shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the<br>fashion?
CONRADE	3	3	1524	1524	1	6	And thought they Margaret was Hero?
CONRADE	3	3	1551	1552	2	11	A commodity in question, I warrant you.—<br>Come, we’ll obey you.
CONRADE	4	2	2075	2076	2	10	I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is<br>Conrade.
CONRADE	4	2	2079	2079	1	4	Yea, sir, we hope.
CONRADE	4	2	2086	2086	1	7	Marry, sir, we say we are none.
CONRADE	4	2	2131	2131	1	2	Off, coxcomb!
CONRADE	4	2	2135	2135	1	9	Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!
DOGBERRY	3	3	1372	1372	1	6	Are you good men and true?
DOGBERRY	3	3	1375	1377	3	23	Nay, that were a punishment too good for<br>them if they should have any allegiance in them,<br>being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1380	1381	2	11	First, who think you the most desartless<br>man to be constable?
DOGBERRY	3	3	1384	1387	4	33	Come hither, neighbor Seacoal.<br>God hath blessed you with a good<br>name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of<br>fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1389	1397	9	85	You have. I knew it would be your answer.<br>Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and<br>make no boast of it, and for your writing and<br>reading, let that appear when there is no need of<br>such vanity. You are thought here to be the most<br>senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch;<br>therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge:<br>you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to<br>bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1399	1401	3	29	Why, then, take no note of him, but let him<br>go, and presently call the rest of the watch together<br>and thank God you are rid of a knave.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1404	1407	4	38	True, and they are to meddle with none but<br>the Prince’s subjects.—You shall also make no<br>noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and<br>to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1410	1414	5	47	Why, you speak like an ancient and most<br>quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping<br>should offend; only have a care that your bills be not<br>stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and<br>bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1416	1418	3	30	Why then, let them alone till they are sober.<br>If they make you not then the better answer, you<br>may say they are not the men you took them for.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1420	1423	4	40	If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by<br>virtue of your office, to be no true man, and for such<br>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with<br>them, why, the more is for your honesty.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1426	1430	5	43	Truly, by your office you may, but I think<br>they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most<br>peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to<br>let him show himself what he is and steal out of<br>your company.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1433	1434	2	20	Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,<br>much more a man who hath any honesty in him.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1439	1442	4	33	Why, then depart in peace, and let the<br>child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will<br>not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a<br>calf when he bleats.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1444	1446	3	28	This is the end of the charge. You, constable,<br>are to present the Prince’s own person. If you<br>meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1448	1452	5	45	Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that<br>knows the statutes, he may stay him—marry, not<br>without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch<br>ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a<br>man against his will.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1454	1457	4	28	Ha, ah ha!—Well, masters, goodnight. An<br>there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.<br>Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and<br>goodnight.—Come, neighbor.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1461	1464	4	31	One word more, honest neighbors. I pray<br>you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the<br>wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil<br>tonight. Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.
DOGBERRY	3	3	1544	1544	1	2	Masters, masters—
DOGBERRY	3	3	1547	1548	2	14	Masters, never<br>speak, we charge you, let us obey you to go with us.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1650	1651	2	13	Marry, sir, I would have some confidence<br>with you that decerns you nearly.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1654	1654	1	5	Marry, this it is, sir.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1657	1660	4	38	Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the<br>matter. An old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt<br>as, God help, I would desire they were, but, in faith,<br>honest as the skin between his brows.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1663	1664	2	6	Comparisons are odorous. <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="es">Palabras</span>, neighbor<br>Verges.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1666	1669	4	41	It pleases your Worship to say so, but we<br>are the poor duke’s officers. But truly, for mine<br>own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find<br>in my heart to bestow it all of your Worship.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1671	1674	4	39	Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more<br>than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your<br>Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be<br>but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1680	1687	8	81	A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As<br>they say, <span class="quote" data-words="9">When the age is in, the wit is out.</span> God<br>help us, it is a world to see!—Well said, i’ faith,<br>neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good man. An two<br>men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An<br>honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever<br>broke bread, but God is to be worshiped, all men<br>are not alike, alas, good neighbor.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1689	1689	1	4	Gifts that God gives.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1691	1694	4	23	One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed<br>comprehended two aspicious persons, and we<br>would have them this morning examined before<br>your Worship.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1698	1698	1	4	It shall be suffigance.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1703	1705	3	26	Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis<br>Seacoal. Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the<br>jail. We are now to examination these men.
DOGBERRY	3	5	1707	1710	4	35	We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.<br>Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.<br>Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication<br>and meet me at the jail.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2061	2061	1	5	Is our whole dissembly appeared?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2064	2064	1	7	Marry, that am I, and my partner.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2070	2071	2	18	Yea, marry, let them come before me.<br>What is your name, friend?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2073	2074	2	6	Pray, write down <span class="quote" data-words="1">Borachio.</span>—Yours,<br>sirrah?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2077	2078	2	10	Write down <span class="quote" data-words="3">Master Gentleman Conrade.</span>—<br>Masters, do you serve God?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2080	2085	6	50	Write down that they hope they serve<br>God; and write God first, for God defend but God<br>should go before such villains!—Masters, it is<br>proved already that you are little better than false<br>knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly.<br>How answer you for yourselves?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2087	2090	4	35	A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you,<br>but I will go about with him.—Come you hither,<br>sirrah, a word in your ear. Sir, I say to you it is<br>thought you are false knaves.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2092	2094	3	19	Well, stand aside.—’Fore God, they are<br>both in a tale. Have you writ down that they are<br>none?
DOGBERRY	4	2	2098	2100	3	22	Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.—Let<br>the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you in the<br>Prince’s name, accuse these men.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2103	2104	2	17	Write down Prince John a villain. Why,<br>this is flat perjury, to call a prince’s brother villain!
DOGBERRY	4	2	2106	2107	2	13	Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy<br>look, I promise thee.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2112	2112	1	6	Flat burglary as ever was committed.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2118	2119	2	11	O, villain! Thou wilt be condemned<br>into everlasting redemption for this!
DOGBERRY	4	2	2129	2129	1	5	Come, let them be opinioned.
DOGBERRY	4	2	2132	2134	3	20	God’s my life, where’s the Sexton? Let<br>him write down the Prince’s officer <span class="quote" data-words="1">coxcomb.</span><br>Come, bind them.—Thou naughty varlet!
DOGBERRY	4	2	2136	2149	14	139	Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost<br>thou not suspect my years? O, that he were here to<br>write me down an ass! But masters, remember that<br>I am an ass, though it be not written down, yet<br>forget not that I am an ass.—No, thou villain, thou<br>art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by<br>good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more,<br>an officer and, which is more, a householder and,<br>which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in<br>Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a<br>rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath had<br>losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything<br>handsome about him.—Bring him away.—O, that I<br>had been writ down an ass!
DOGBERRY	5	1	2366	2369	4	30	Come you, sir. If justice cannot tame you,<br>she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance.<br>Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must<br>be looked to.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2374	2378	5	37	Marry, sir, they have committed false<br>report; moreover, they have spoken untruths;<br>secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they<br>have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust<br>things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2413	2416	4	35	Come, bring away the plaintiffs. By this<br>time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of<br>the matter. And, masters, do not forget to specify,<br>when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2468	2477	10	89	Moreover, sir, which indeed is<br>not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the<br>offender, did call me ass. I beseech you, let it be<br>remembered in his punishment. And also the watch<br>heard them talk of one Deformed. They say he<br>wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and<br>borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath<br>used so long and never paid that now men grow<br>hardhearted and will lend nothing for God’s sake.<br>Pray you, examine him upon that point.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2479	2480	2	16	Your Worship speaks like a most thankful<br>and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2482	2482	1	4	God save the foundation.
DOGBERRY	5	1	2485	2491	7	59	I leave an arrant knave with your Worship,<br>which I beseech your Worship to correct<br>yourself, for the example of others. God keep your<br>Worship! I wish your Worship well. God restore you<br>to health. I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a<br>merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it.—<br>Come, neighbor.
DON_JOHN	1	1	154	155	2	13	I thank you. I am not of many words, but I<br>thank you.
DON_JOHN	1	3	354	355	2	15	There is no measure in the occasion that<br>breeds. Therefore the sadness is without limit.
DON_JOHN	1	3	357	358	2	10	And when I have heard it, what blessing<br>brings it?
DON_JOHN	1	3	361	368	8	78	I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou<br>art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral<br>medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide<br>what I am. I must be sad when I have cause, and<br>smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach,<br>and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am<br>drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when<br>I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.
DON_JOHN	1	3	376	386	11	114	I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a<br>rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be<br>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob<br>love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be<br>a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I<br>am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a<br>muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I<br>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my<br>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do<br>my liking. In the meantime, let me be that I am, and<br>seek not to alter me.
DON_JOHN	1	3	388	390	3	19	I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who<br>comes here?<br>What news, Borachio?
DON_JOHN	1	3	395	397	3	21	Will it serve for any model to build mischief<br>on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to<br>unquietness?
DON_JOHN	1	3	399	399	1	5	Who, the most exquisite Claudio?
DON_JOHN	1	3	401	402	2	11	A proper squire. And who, and who? Which<br>way looks he?
DON_JOHN	1	3	405	406	2	10	A very forward March chick! How came you<br>to this?
DON_JOHN	1	3	414	418	5	42	Come, come, let us thither. This may prove<br>food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath<br>all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any<br>way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and<br>will assist me?
DON_JOHN	1	3	420	422	3	30	Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the<br>greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were o’<br>my mind! Shall we go prove what’s to be done?
DON_JOHN	2	1	576	579	4	27	Sure my brother is amorous<br>on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break<br>with him about it. The ladies follow her, and but one<br>visor remains.
DON_JOHN	2	1	582	582	1	5	Are not you Signior Benedick?
DON_JOHN	2	1	584	587	4	40	Signior, you are very near my brother in his<br>love. He is enamored on Hero. I pray you dissuade<br>him from her. She is no equal for his birth. You<br>may do the part of an honest man in it.
DON_JOHN	2	1	589	589	1	6	I heard him swear his affection.
DON_JOHN	2	1	592	592	1	6	Come, let us to the banquet.
DON_JOHN	2	2	802	803	2	12	It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the<br>daughter of Leonato.
DON_JOHN	2	2	805	809	5	34	Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be<br>med’cinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him,<br>and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges<br>evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this<br>marriage?
DON_JOHN	2	2	812	812	1	4	Show me briefly how.
DON_JOHN	2	2	816	816	1	2	I remember.
DON_JOHN	2	2	820	821	2	12	What life is in that to be the death of this<br>marriage?
DON_JOHN	2	2	828	828	1	7	What proof shall I make of that?
DON_JOHN	2	2	832	833	2	8	Only to despite them I will endeavor<br>anything.
DON_JOHN	2	2	851	853	3	27	Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will<br>put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this,<br>and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
DON_JOHN	2	2	856	857	2	9	I will presently go learn their day of<br>marriage.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1317	1317	1	7	My lord and brother, God save you.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1319	1320	2	9	If your leisure served, I would speak with<br>you.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1322	1323	2	17	If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may<br>hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1325	1326	2	7	Means your Lordship to be<br>married tomorrow?
DON_JOHN	3	2	1328	1329	2	10	I know not that, when he knows what I<br>know.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1332	1337	6	51	You may think I love you not. Let that<br>appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I<br>now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds<br>you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect<br>your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and<br>labor ill bestowed.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1339	1341	3	21	I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances<br>shortened, for she has been too long<br>a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1343	1344	2	9	Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every<br>man’s Hero.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1346	1353	8	72	The word is too good to paint out her<br>wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you<br>of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not<br>till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you<br>shall see her chamber window entered, even the<br>night before her wedding day. If you love her then,<br>tomorrow wed her. But it would better fit your<br>honor to change your mind.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1356	1359	4	34	If you dare not trust that you see, confess<br>not that you know. If you will follow me, I will<br>show you enough, and when you have seen more<br>and heard more, proceed accordingly.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1365	1367	3	23	I will disparage her no farther till you are<br>my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight, and<br>let the issue show itself.
DON_JOHN	3	2	1370	1371	2	15	O plague right well prevented! So will you<br>say when you have seen the sequel.
DON_JOHN	4	1	1780	1780	1	9	Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
DON_JOHN	4	1	1810	1814	5	37	Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord,<br>Not to be spoke of!<br>There is not chastity enough in language,<br>Without offense, to utter them.—Thus, pretty lady,<br>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
DON_JOHN	4	1	1826	1827	2	14	Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,<br>Smother her spirits up.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	101	102	2	15	You embrace your charge too willingly.<br>I think this is your daughter.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	107	110	4	31	You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by<br>this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady<br>fathers herself.—Be happy, lady, for you are like<br>an honorable father.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	144	149	6	54	That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior<br>Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend<br>Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay<br>here at the least a month, and he heartily prays<br>some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear<br>he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	157	157	1	7	Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	200	201	2	12	What secret hath held you here that you followed<br>not to Leonato’s?
DON_PEDRO	1	1	204	204	1	6	I charge thee on thy allegiance.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	217	218	2	12	Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well<br>worthy.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	220	220	1	7	By my troth, I speak my thought.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	225	225	1	6	That she is worthy, I know.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	230	231	2	11	Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the<br>despite of beauty.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	243	243	1	11	I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	250	251	2	15	Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou<br>wilt prove a notable argument.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	255	256	2	14	Well, as time shall try.<br>In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	265	266	2	17	Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in<br>Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	268	272	5	37	Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the<br>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s.<br>Commend me to him, and tell him I will not<br>fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great<br>preparation.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	277	278	2	8	The sixth of July. Your loving friend,<br>Benedick.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	285	287	3	28	My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,<br>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn<br>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	289	290	2	13	No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.<br>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
DON_PEDRO	1	1	301	306	6	54	Thou wilt be like a lover presently<br>And tire the hearer with a book of words.<br>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,<br>And I will break with her and with her father,<br>And thou shalt have her. Was ’t not to this end<br>That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?
DON_PEDRO	1	1	311	323	13	101	What need the bridge much broader than the flood?<br>The fairest grant is the necessity.<br>Look what will serve is fit. ’Tis once, thou lovest,<br>And I will fit thee with the remedy.<br>I know we shall have reveling tonight.<br>I will assume thy part in some disguise<br>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,<br>And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart<br>And take her hearing prisoner with the force<br>And strong encounter of my amorous tale.<br>Then after to her father will I break,<br>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.<br>In practice let us put it presently.
DON_PEDRO	1	1	94	96	3	23	Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet<br>your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid<br>cost, and you encounter it.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	507	508	2	13	Lady, will you walk a bout with your<br>friend?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	512	512	1	5	With me in your company?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	514	514	1	7	And when please you to say so?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	517	518	2	10	My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house<br>is Jove.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	520	520	1	6	Speak low if you speak love.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	631	632	2	9	Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see<br>him?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	641	641	1	6	To be whipped? What’s his fault?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	645	646	2	13	Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The<br>transgression is in the stealer.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	652	653	2	13	I will but teach them to sing and restore them<br>to the owner.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	656	658	3	22	The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The<br>gentleman that danced with her told her she is<br>much wronged by you.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	681	681	1	4	Look, here she comes.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	691	691	1	7	None but to desire your good company.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	694	695	2	11	Come, lady, come, you have lost<br>the heart of Signior Benedick.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	701	702	2	11	You have put him down, lady, you have put<br>him down.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	706	706	1	8	Why, how now, count, wherefore are you sad?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	708	708	1	3	How then, sick?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	713	718	6	55	I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,<br>though I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is<br>false.—Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,<br>and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father<br>and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage,<br>and God give thee joy.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	729	729	1	8	In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	737	737	1	7	Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	742	742	1	5	Will you have me, lady?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	747	749	3	23	Your silence most offends me, and to be merry<br>best becomes you, for out o’ question you were<br>born in a merry hour.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	757	757	1	6	By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	763	763	1	9	She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	766	766	1	7	She were an excellent wife for Benedick.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	769	770	2	9	County Claudio, when mean you to go to<br>church?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	776	784	9	82	Come, you shake the head at so<br>long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the<br>time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim<br>undertake one of Hercules’ labors, which is to bring<br>Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a<br>mountain of affection, th’ one with th’ other. I<br>would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to<br>fashion it, if you three will but minister such<br>assistance as I shall give you direction.
DON_PEDRO	2	1	788	788	1	5	And you too, gentle Hero?
DON_PEDRO	2	1	791	801	11	108	And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband<br>that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of<br>a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed<br>honesty. I will teach you how to humor your<br>cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.—<br>And I, with your two helps, will so practice on<br>Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his<br>queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice.<br>If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his<br>glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go<br>in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1018	1019	2	17	It were good that Benedick knew of it by some<br>other, if she will not discover it.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1022	1024	3	23	An he should, it were an alms to hang him.<br>She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion,<br>she is virtuous.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1026	1026	1	6	In everything but in loving Benedick.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1031	1034	4	34	I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I<br>would have daffed all other respects and made her<br>half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear<br>what he will say.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1041	1043	3	28	She doth well. If she should make tender of<br>her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man,<br>as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1045	1045	1	7	He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1047	1048	2	10	He doth indeed show some sparks that are like<br>wit.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1050	1053	4	33	As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing<br>of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he<br>avoids them with great discretion or undertakes<br>them with a most Christianlike fear.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1057	1060	4	42	And so will he do, for the man doth fear God,<br>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests<br>he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall<br>we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1065	1068	4	39	Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter.<br>Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I<br>could wish he would modestly examine himself to<br>see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	1073	1079	7	59	Let there be the same net<br>spread for her, and that must your daughter and her<br>gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they<br>hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no<br>such matter. That’s the scene that I would see,<br>which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her<br>to call him in to dinner.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	894	894	1	6	Come, shall we hear this music?
DON_PEDRO	2	3	897	897	1	7	See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
DON_PEDRO	2	3	900	900	1	7	Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	903	905	3	26	It is the witness still of excellency<br>To put a strange face on his own perfection.<br>I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	910	912	3	15	Nay, pray thee, come,<br>Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br>Do it in notes.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	915	916	2	15	Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!<br>Note notes, forsooth, and nothing.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	937	937	1	6	By my troth, a good song.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	939	940	2	11	Ha, no, no, faith, thou sing’st well enough for a<br>shift.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	946	949	4	27	Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray<br>thee get us some excellent music, for tomorrow<br>night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber<br>window.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	951	954	4	26	Do so. Farewell.<br>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of<br>today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with<br>Signior Benedick?
DON_PEDRO	2	3	967	967	1	5	Maybe she doth but counterfeit.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	972	972	1	7	Why, what effects of passion shows she?
DON_PEDRO	2	3	978	980	3	22	How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would<br>have thought her spirit had been invincible against<br>all assaults of affection.
DON_PEDRO	2	3	988	989	2	8	Hath she made her affection known to<br>Benedick?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1245	1246	2	15	I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,<br>and then go I toward Aragon.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1249	1258	10	96	Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new<br>gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new<br>coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold<br>with Benedick for his company, for from the crown<br>of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He<br>hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the<br>little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a<br>heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the<br>clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue<br>speaks.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1262	1264	3	24	Hang him, truant! There’s no true drop of<br>blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be<br>sad, he wants money.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1266	1266	1	2	Draw it.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1269	1269	1	5	What, sigh for the toothache?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1274	1281	8	82	There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless<br>it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to<br>be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or<br>in the shape of two countries at once, as a German<br>from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard<br>from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a<br>fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no<br>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1285	1285	1	8	Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1291	1292	2	13	Nay, he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell<br>him out by that?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1295	1295	1	8	The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1297	1298	2	15	Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear<br>what they say of him.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1301	1302	2	14	Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude,<br>conclude, he is in love.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1304	1305	2	12	That would I know, too. I warrant, one that<br>knows him not.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1308	1308	1	8	She shall be buried with her face upwards.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1313	1313	1	9	For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1318	1318	1	3	Good e’en, brother.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1321	1321	1	2	In private?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1324	1324	1	3	What’s the matter?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1327	1327	1	4	You know he does.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1338	1338	1	4	Why, what’s the matter?
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1355	1355	1	5	I will not think it.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1363	1364	2	17	And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will<br>join with thee to disgrace her.
DON_PEDRO	3	2	1368	1368	1	4	O day untowardly turned!
DON_PEDRO	4	1	1739	1739	1	6	Nothing, unless you render her again.
DON_PEDRO	4	1	1775	1778	4	20	What should I<br>speak?<br>I stand dishonored that have gone about<br>To link my dear friend to a common stale.
DON_PEDRO	4	1	1802	1809	8	61	Why, then, are you no maiden.—Leonato,<br>I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor,<br>Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count<br>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window,<br>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br>Confessed the vile encounters they have had<br>A thousand times in secret.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2197	2197	1	4	Good e’en, good e’en.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2200	2201	2	5	We have some haste,<br>Leonato.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2204	2204	1	9	Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2231	2231	1	6	You say not right, old man.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2264	2267	4	34	Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.<br>My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death,<br>But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing<br>But what was true and very full of proof.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2269	2269	1	5	I will not hear you.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2272	2272	1	10	See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2275	2276	2	11	Welcome, signior. You are almost come to<br>part almost a fray.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2279	2281	3	20	Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou?<br>Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too<br>young for them.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2288	2288	1	8	Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2292	2293	2	14	As I am an honest man, he looks pale.—Art<br>thou sick, or angry?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2302	2303	2	14	By this light, he changes more and more. I<br>think he be angry indeed.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2315	2315	1	5	What, a feast, a feast?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2321	2330	14	123	I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the<br>other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit. <span class="quote" data-words="1">True,</span> said<br>she, <span class="quote" data-words="4">a fine little one.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">No,</span> said I, <span class="quote" data-words="3">a great wit.</span><br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Right,</span> says she, <span class="quote" data-words="4">a great gross one.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">Nay,</span> said I,<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">a good wit.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">Just,</span> said she, <span class="quote" data-words="3">it hurts nobody.</span><br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Nay,</span> said I, <span class="quote" data-words="4">the gentleman is wise.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">Certain,</span><br>said she, <span class="quote" data-words="3">a wise gentleman.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="1">Nay,</span> said I, <span class="quote" data-words="4">hehath the tongues.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="3">That I believe,</span> said she, <span class="quote" data-words="23">for heswore a thing to me on Monday night which he<br>forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double<br>tongue, there’s two tongues.</span> Thus did she an hour<br>together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at<br>last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the<br>proper’st man in Italy.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2337	2339	3	29	Yea, that she did. But yet for all that, an if she<br>did not hate him deadly, she would love him<br>dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2342	2343	2	14	But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns<br>on the sensible Benedick’s head?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2355	2355	1	4	He is in earnest.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2358	2358	1	4	And hath challenged thee?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2360	2361	2	19	What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his<br>doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2364	2365	2	21	But soft you, let me be. Pluck up, my heart,<br>and be sad. Did he not say my brother was fled?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2370	2371	2	10	How now, two of my brother’s men bound?<br>Borachio one!
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2373	2373	1	7	Officers, what offense have these men done?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2379	2382	4	31	First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I<br>ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why<br>they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay<br>to their charge.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2385	2388	4	25	Who have you offended,<br>masters, that you are thus bound to your<br>answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be<br>understood. What’s your offense?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2404	2404	1	9	Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2406	2406	1	9	But did my brother set thee on to this?
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2409	2410	2	14	He is composed and framed of treachery,<br>And fled he is upon this villainy.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2437	2440	4	25	By my soul, nor I,<br>And yet to satisfy this good old man<br>I would bend under any heavy weight<br>That he’ll enjoin me to.
DON_PEDRO	5	1	2494	2494	1	4	We will not fail.
DON_PEDRO	5	3	2625	2629	5	41	Good morrow, masters. Put your torches out.<br>The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day<br>Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about<br>Dapples the drowsy east with spots of gray.<br>Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well.
DON_PEDRO	5	3	2631	2632	2	16	Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds,<br>And then to Leonato’s we will go.
DON_PEDRO	5	4	2669	2669	1	6	Good morrow to this fair assembly.
DON_PEDRO	5	4	2675	2677	3	22	Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter<br>That you have such a February face,<br>So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?
DON_PEDRO	5	4	2701	2701	1	7	The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
DON_PEDRO	5	4	2737	2737	1	7	How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
DON_PEDRO	5	4	2763	2764	2	17	My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,<br>And brought with armed men back to Messina.
DON_PEDROS_MESSENGER	5	4	2763	2764	2	17	My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,<br>And brought with armed men back to Messina.
FIRST_LORD	5	3	2603	2603	1	4	It is, my lord.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1382	1383	2	12	Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal,<br>for they can write and read.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1496	1498	3	25	I know that Deformed. He<br>has been a vile thief this seven year. He goes up and<br>down like a gentleman. I remember his name.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1536	1537	2	8	We charge you in the Prince’s name<br>stand!
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1542	1543	2	14	And one Deformed is one of them. I<br>know him; he wears a lock.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1545	1546	2	9	You’ll be made bring<br>Deformed forth, I warrant you.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	4	2	2101	2102	2	13	This man said, sir, that Don John, the<br>Prince’s brother, was a villain.
FIRST_WATCHMAN-ADO	4	2	2115	2117	3	20	And that Count Claudio did mean,<br>upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole<br>assembly, and not marry her.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1714	1715	2	9	You come hither, my lord, to marry<br>this lady?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1719	1720	2	10	Lady, you come hither to be married to this<br>count?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1722	1724	3	23	If either of you know any inward impediment<br>why you should not be conjoined, I charge you on<br>your souls to utter it.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1727	1727	1	4	Know you any, count?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1835	1835	1	3	Have comfort, lady.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1837	1837	1	5	Yea, wherefore should she not?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1874	1889	16	112	Hear me a little,<br>For I have only silent beenso long,<br>And given way unto this course of fortune,<br>By noting of the lady. I have marked<br>A thousand blushing apparitions<br>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames<br>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,<br>And in her eye there hath appeared a fire<br>To burn the errors that these princes hold<br>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,<br>Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br>Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<br>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<br>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here<br>Under some biting error.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1896	1896	1	9	Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1905	1905	1	8	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1921	1929	9	56	Pause awhile,<br>And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br>Your daughter here the princes left for dead.<br>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br>And publish it that she is dead indeed.<br>Maintain a mourning ostentation,<br>And on your family’s old monument<br>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<br>That appertain unto a burial.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1931	1964	34	268	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br>Change slander to remorse. That is some good.<br>But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br>But on this travail look for greater birth.<br>She, dying, as it must be so maintained,<br>Upon the instant that she was accused,<br>Shall be lamented, pitied, and excused<br>Of every hearer. For it so falls out<br>That what we have we prize not to the worth<br>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost,<br>Why then we rack the value, then we find<br>The virtue that possession would not show us<br>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.<br>When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br>Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br>Into his study of imagination,<br>And every lovely organ of her life<br>Shall come appareled in more precious habit,<br>More moving, delicate, and full of life,<br>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br>Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn,<br>If ever love had interest in his liver,<br>And wish he had not so accused her,<br>No, though he thought his accusation true.<br>Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br>Will fashion the event in better shape<br>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br>But if all aim but this be leveled false,<br>The supposition of the lady’s death<br>Will quench the wonder of her infamy.<br>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<br>As best befits her wounded reputation,<br>In some reclusive and religious life,<br>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	4	1	1973	1978	6	36	’Tis well consented. Presently away,<br>For to strange sores strangely they strain the<br>cure.—<br>Come, lady, die to live. This wedding day<br>Perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience and<br>endure.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	5	4	2635	2635	1	8	Did I not tell you she was innocent?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	5	4	2653	2653	1	4	To do what, signior?
FRIAR_FRANCIS	5	4	2667	2668	2	9	And my help.<br>Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
FRIAR_FRANCIS	5	4	2703	2707	5	34	All this amazement can I qualify,<br>When after that the holy rites are ended,<br>I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.<br>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,<br>And to the chapel let us presently.
HERO	1	1	35	35	1	7	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
HERO	2	1	428	428	1	7	He is of a very melancholy disposition.
HERO	2	1	509	511	3	22	So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say<br>nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially<br>when I walk away.
HERO	2	1	513	513	1	7	I may say so when I please.
HERO	2	1	515	516	2	15	When I like your favor, for God defend the lute<br>should be like the case.
HERO	2	1	519	519	1	7	Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
HERO	2	1	789	790	2	16	I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my<br>cousin to a good husband.
HERO	3	1	1123	1136	14	103	Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.<br>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice<br>Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.<br>Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula<br>Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse<br>Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,<br>And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower<br>Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun<br>Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites<br>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride<br>Against that power that bred it. There will she hide<br>her<br>To listen our propose. This is thy office.<br>Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.
HERO	3	1	1138	1148	11	87	Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,<br>As we do trace this alley up and down,<br>Our talk must only be of Benedick.<br>When I do name him, let it be thy part<br>To praise him more than ever man did merit.<br>My talk to thee must be how Benedick<br>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter<br>Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,<br>That only wounds by hearsay. Now begin,<br>For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs<br>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
HERO	3	1	1155	1159	5	46	Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing<br>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.—<br>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.<br>I know her spirits are as coy and wild<br>As haggards of the rock.
HERO	3	1	1162	1162	1	8	So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.
HERO	3	1	1164	1167	4	31	They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,<br>But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,<br>To wish him wrestle with affection<br>And never to let Beatrice know of it.
HERO	3	1	1171	1180	10	75	O god of love! I know he doth deserve<br>As much as may be yielded to a man,<br>But Nature never framed a woman’s heart<br>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.<br>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,<br>Misprizing what they look on, and her wit<br>Values itself so highly that to her<br>All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,<br>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,<br>She is so self-endeared.
HERO	3	1	1184	1196	13	97	Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,<br>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,<br>But she would spell him backward. If fair-faced,<br>She would swear the gentleman should be her<br>sister;<br>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,<br>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<br>If low, an agate very vilely cut;<br>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<br>If silent, why, a block moved with none.<br>So turns she every man the wrong side out,<br>And never gives to truth and virtue that<br>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
HERO	3	1	1198	1207	10	75	No, not to be so odd and from all fashions<br>As Beatrice is cannot be commendable.<br>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<br>She would mock me into air. O, she would laugh<br>me<br>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<br>Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire,<br>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.<br>It were a better death than die with mocks,<br>Which is as bad as die with tickling.
HERO	3	1	1209	1213	5	39	No, rather I will go to Benedick<br>And counsel him to fight against his passion;<br>And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders<br>To stain my cousin with. One doth not know<br>How much an ill word may empoison liking.
HERO	3	1	1219	1220	2	12	He is the only man of Italy,<br>Always excepted my dear Claudio.
HERO	3	1	1225	1225	1	7	Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
HERO	3	1	1228	1230	3	24	Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in.<br>I’ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel<br>Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.
HERO	3	1	1233	1234	2	17	If it prove so, then loving goes by haps;<br>Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
HERO	3	4	1553	1554	2	11	Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and<br>desire her to rise.
HERO	3	4	1556	1556	1	5	And bid her come hither.
HERO	3	4	1560	1560	1	8	No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.
HERO	3	4	1563	1564	2	13	My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another. I’ll<br>wear none but this.
HERO	3	4	1569	1569	1	5	O, that exceeds, they say.
HERO	3	4	1576	1577	2	13	God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is<br>exceeding heavy.
HERO	3	4	1580	1580	1	6	Fie upon thee! Art not ashamed?
HERO	3	4	1591	1591	1	3	Good morrow, coz.
HERO	3	4	1593	1593	1	10	Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune?
HERO	3	4	1612	1613	2	11	These gloves the Count sent me, they are an<br>excellent perfume.
HERO	3	4	1626	1626	1	7	There thou prick’st her with a thistle.
HERO	3	4	1647	1648	2	10	Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good<br>Ursula.
HERO	4	1	1721	1721	1	2	I do.
HERO	4	1	1726	1726	1	3	None, my lord.
HERO	4	1	1766	1766	1	7	And seemed I ever otherwise to you?
HERO	4	1	1773	1773	1	10	Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide?
HERO	4	1	1782	1782	1	3	True! O God!
HERO	4	1	1791	1792	2	15	O, God defend me, how am I beset!—<br>What kind of catechizing call you this?
HERO	4	1	1794	1795	2	13	Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br>With any just reproach?
HERO	4	1	1801	1801	1	10	I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.
HERO	4	1	1897	1904	8	64	They know that do accuse me. I know none.<br>If I know more of any man alive<br>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,<br>Let all my sins lack mercy!—O my father,<br>Prove you that any man with me conversed<br>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight<br>Maintained the change of words with any creature,<br>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
HERO	5	4	2695	2696	2	18	And when I lived, I was your other wife,<br>And when you loved, you were my other husband.
HERO	5	4	2698	2700	3	19	Nothing certainer.<br>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,<br>And surely as I live, I am a maid.
HERO	5	4	2727	2729	3	17	And here’s another,<br>Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol’n from her pocket,<br>Containing her affection unto Benedick.
LEONATO	1	1	1	2	2	15	I learn in this letter that Don<br>Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.
LEONATO	1	1	103	103	1	8	Her mother hath many times told me so.
LEONATO	1	1	105	106	2	9	Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a<br>child.
LEONATO	1	1	12	17	6	49	Much deserved on his part, and equally<br>remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself<br>beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure<br>of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better<br>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<br>tell you how.
LEONATO	1	1	150	153	4	32	If you swear, my lord, you shall not be<br>forsworn. Let me bid you welcome,<br>my lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother,<br>I owe you all duty.
LEONATO	1	1	156	156	1	6	Please it your Grace lead on?
LEONATO	1	1	18	19	2	14	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be<br>very much glad of it.
LEONATO	1	1	20	23	4	29	I have already delivered him letters, and<br>there appears much joy in him, even so much that<br>joy could not show itself modest enough without a<br>badge of bitterness.
LEONATO	1	1	24	24	1	6	Did he break out into tears?
LEONATO	1	1	25	25	1	3	In great measure.
LEONATO	1	1	26	29	4	30	A kind overflow of kindness. There are no<br>faces truer than those that are so washed. How<br>much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at<br>weeping!
LEONATO	1	1	3	4	2	16	He is very near by this. He was not three<br>leagues off when I left him.
LEONATO	1	1	32	33	2	17	I know none of that name, lady. There<br>was none such in the army of any sort.
LEONATO	1	1	34	34	1	8	What is he that you ask for, niece?
LEONATO	1	1	36	37	2	10	O, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever<br>he was.
LEONATO	1	1	45	46	2	18	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too<br>much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
LEONATO	1	1	47	48	2	9	He hath done good service, lady, in these<br>wars.
LEONATO	1	1	5	6	2	9	How many gentlemen have you lost in this<br>action?
LEONATO	1	1	52	52	1	6	And a good soldier too, lady.
LEONATO	1	1	55	56	2	15	A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed<br>with all honorable virtues.
LEONATO	1	1	59	62	4	30	You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is<br>a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and<br>her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit<br>between them.
LEONATO	1	1	7	7	1	9	But few of any sort, and none of name.
LEONATO	1	1	72	72	1	3	Is ’t possible?
LEONATO	1	1	76	77	2	10	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your<br>books.
LEONATO	1	1	8	11	4	28	A victory is twice itself when the achiever<br>brings home full numbers. I find here that Don<br>Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young<br>Florentine called Claudio.
LEONATO	1	1	82	83	2	11	He is most in the company of the right<br>noble Claudio.
LEONATO	1	1	89	89	1	7	I will hold friends with you, lady.
LEONATO	1	1	91	91	1	6	You will never run mad, niece.
LEONATO	1	1	93	93	1	4	Don Pedro is approached.
LEONATO	1	1	97	100	4	32	Never came trouble to my house in the<br>likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone,<br>comfort should remain, but when you depart from<br>me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
LEONATO	1	2	324	325	2	14	How now, brother, where is my cousin, your<br>son? Hath he provided this music?
LEONATO	1	2	326	328	3	20	He is very busy about it. But,<br>brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet<br>dreamt not of.
LEONATO	1	2	329	329	1	3	Are they good?
LEONATO	1	2	330	339	10	82	As the events stamps them, but<br>they have a good cover; they show well outward.<br>The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached<br>alley in mine orchard, were thus much<br>overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered<br>to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and<br>meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if<br>he found her accordant, he meant to take the<br>present time by the top and instantly break with you<br>of it.
LEONATO	1	2	340	340	1	9	Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
LEONATO	1	2	341	342	2	13	A good sharp fellow. I will send<br>for him, and question him yourself.
LEONATO	1	2	343	351	9	82	No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it<br>appear itself. But I will acquaint my daughter<br>withal, that she may be the better prepared for an<br>answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell<br>her of it.<br>Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry<br>you mercy, friend. Go you with me and I will use<br>your skill.—Good cousin, have a care this busy<br>time.
LEONATO	2	1	424	424	1	7	Was not Count John here at supper?
LEONATO	2	1	425	425	1	4	I saw him not.
LEONATO	2	1	434	436	3	18	Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in<br>Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy<br>in Signior Benedick’s face—
LEONATO	2	1	441	442	2	19	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a<br>husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
LEONATO	2	1	443	443	1	5	In faith, she’s too curst.
LEONATO	2	1	448	449	2	11	So, by being too curst, God will send you no<br>horns.
LEONATO	2	1	455	456	2	10	You may light on a husband that hath no<br>beard.
LEONATO	2	1	465	465	1	6	Well then, go you into hell?
LEONATO	2	1	473	474	2	11	Well, niece, I trust you<br>will be ruled by your father.
LEONATO	2	1	480	481	2	13	Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted<br>with a husband.
LEONATO	2	1	488	490	3	19	Daughter, remember what I told<br>you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you<br>know your answer.
LEONATO	2	1	502	502	1	5	Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
LEONATO	2	1	505	506	2	14	The revelers are entering, brother. Make<br>good room.
LEONATO	2	1	719	721	3	24	Count, take of me my daughter, and with her<br>my fortunes. His Grace hath made the match, and<br>all grace say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Amen</span> to it.
LEONATO	2	1	753	754	2	11	Niece, will you look to those things I told<br>you of?
LEONATO	2	1	758	762	5	41	There’s little of the melancholy element in<br>her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps,<br>and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter<br>say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and<br>waked herself with laughing.
LEONATO	2	1	764	765	2	12	O, by no means. She mocks all her wooers<br>out of suit.
LEONATO	2	1	767	768	2	16	O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week<br>married, they would talk themselves mad.
LEONATO	2	1	773	775	3	25	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence<br>a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have<br>all things answer my mind.
LEONATO	2	1	785	786	2	13	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten<br>nights’ watchings.
LEONATO	2	3	1001	1003	3	19	O, when she had writ it and was reading it<br>over, she found <span class="quote" data-words="1">Benedick</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="1">Beatrice</span> between<br>the sheet?
LEONATO	2	3	1005	1008	6	54	O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,<br>railed at herself that she should be so<br>immodest to write to one that she knew would flout<br>her. <span class="quote" data-words="3">I measure him,</span> says she, <span class="quote" data-words="21">by my own spirit,for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I<br>love him, I should.</span>
LEONATO	2	3	1014	1017	4	33	She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and<br>the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my<br>daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate<br>outrage to herself. It is very true.
LEONATO	2	3	1027	1030	4	39	O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in<br>so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that<br>blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have<br>just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
LEONATO	2	3	1035	1035	1	5	Were it good, think you?
LEONATO	2	3	1054	1056	3	26	If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep<br>peace. If he break the peace, he ought to enter into<br>a quarrel with fear and trembling.
LEONATO	2	3	1063	1064	2	10	Nay, that’s impossible; she may wear her<br>heart out first.
LEONATO	2	3	1069	1069	1	8	My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.
LEONATO	2	3	958	961	4	26	No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that<br>she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she<br>hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to<br>abhor.
LEONATO	2	3	964	966	3	29	By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to<br>think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged<br>affection, it is past the infinite of thought.
LEONATO	2	3	969	971	3	20	O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit<br>of passion came so near the life of passion as<br>she discovers it.
LEONATO	2	3	975	976	2	15	What effects, my lord? She will sit you—you<br>heard my daughter tell you how.
LEONATO	2	3	981	982	2	11	I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially<br>against Benedick.
LEONATO	2	3	990	991	2	9	No, and swears she never will. That’s her<br>torment.
LEONATO	2	3	995	998	4	41	This says she now when she is beginning to<br>write to him, for she’ll be up twenty times a night,<br>and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ<br>a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.
LEONATO	3	2	1260	1260	1	7	So say I. Methinks you are sadder.
LEONATO	3	2	1270	1270	1	8	Where is but a humor or a worm.
LEONATO	3	2	1289	1290	2	13	Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the<br>loss of a beard.
LEONATO	3	5	1649	1649	1	7	What would you with me, honest neighbor?
LEONATO	3	5	1652	1653	2	14	Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time<br>with me.
LEONATO	3	5	1656	1656	1	6	What is it, my good friends?
LEONATO	3	5	1665	1665	1	4	Neighbors, you are tedious.
LEONATO	3	5	1670	1670	1	6	All thy tediousness on me, ah?
LEONATO	3	5	1676	1676	1	9	I would fain know what you have to say.
LEONATO	3	5	1688	1688	1	8	Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.
LEONATO	3	5	1690	1690	1	4	I must leave you.
LEONATO	3	5	1695	1697	3	20	Take their examination yourself and bring it<br>me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto<br>you.
LEONATO	3	5	1699	1699	1	9	Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you well.
LEONATO	3	5	1700	1701	2	13	My lord, they stay for you to give your<br>daughter to her husband.
LEONATO	3	5	1702	1702	1	7	I’ll wait upon them. I am ready.
LEONATO	4	1	1711	1713	3	20	Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the<br>plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their<br>particular duties afterwards.
LEONATO	4	1	1717	1718	2	11	To be married to her.—Friar, you come to<br>marry her.
LEONATO	4	1	1728	1728	1	6	I dare make his answer, none.
LEONATO	4	1	1736	1736	1	9	As freely, son, as God did give her me.
LEONATO	4	1	1753	1753	1	6	What do you mean, my lord?
LEONATO	4	1	1756	1758	3	22	Dear my lord, if you in your own proof<br>Have vanquished the resistance of her youth,<br>And made defeat of her virginity—
LEONATO	4	1	1774	1774	1	6	Sweet prince, why speak not you?
LEONATO	4	1	1779	1779	1	9	Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
LEONATO	4	1	1786	1786	1	10	All this is so, but what of this, my lord?
LEONATO	4	1	1790	1790	1	10	I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
LEONATO	4	1	1824	1824	1	9	Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?
LEONATO	4	1	1831	1833	3	21	O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand!<br>Death is the fairest cover for her shame<br>That may be wished for.
LEONATO	4	1	1836	1836	1	4	Dost thou look up?
LEONATO	4	1	1838	1860	24	200	Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing<br>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<br>The story that is printed in her blood?—<br>Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes,<br>For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<br>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<br>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,<br>Strike at thy life. Grieved I I had but one?<br>Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?<br>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<br>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<br>Why had I not with charitable hand<br>Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates,<br>Who, smirchèd thus, and mired with infamy,<br>I might have said <span class="quote" data-words="13">No part of it is mine;This shame derives itself from unknown loins</span>?<br>But mine, and mine I loved, and mine I praised,<br>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<br>That I myself was to myself not mine,<br>Valuing of her—why she, O she, is fall’n<br>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,<br>And salt too little which may season give<br>To her foul tainted flesh!
LEONATO	4	1	1869	1873	5	43	Confirmed, confirmed! O, that is stronger made<br>Which was before barred up with ribs of iron!<br>Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie,<br>Who loved her so that, speaking of her foulness,<br>Washed it with tears? Hence from her. Let her die!
LEONATO	4	1	1890	1895	6	45	Friar, it cannot be.<br>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<br>Is that she will not add to her damnation<br>A sin of perjury. She not denies it.<br>Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse<br>That which appears in proper nakedness?
LEONATO	4	1	1910	1920	11	94	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br>These hands shall tear her. If they wrong her honor,<br>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br>Nor age so eat up my invention,<br>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<br>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br>Ability in means and choice of friends,<br>To quit me of them throughly.
LEONATO	4	1	1930	1930	1	9	What shall become of this? What will this do?
LEONATO	4	1	1971	1972	2	12	Being that I flow in grief,<br>The smallest twine may lead me.
LEONATO	5	1	2150	2152	3	19	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,<br>And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief<br>Against yourself.
LEONATO	5	1	2153	2183	31	235	I pray thee, cease thy counsel,<br>Which falls into mine ears as profitless<br>As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,<br>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.<br>Bring me a father that so loved his child,<br>Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,<br>And bid him speak of patience.<br>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,<br>And let it answer every strain for strain,<br>As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,<br>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.<br>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<br>Bid sorrow wag, cry <span class="quote" data-words="1">hem</span> when he should<br>groan,<br>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk<br>With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me,<br>And I of him will gather patience.<br>But there is no such man. For, brother, men<br>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br>Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,<br>Their counsel turns to passion, which before<br>Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,<br>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<br>Charm ache with air and agony with words.<br>No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience<br>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<br>But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency<br>To be so moral when he shall endure<br>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.<br>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
LEONATO	5	1	2184	2184	1	7	Therein do men from children nothing differ.
LEONATO	5	1	2185	2189	5	38	I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood,<br>For there was never yet philosopher<br>That could endure the toothache patiently,<br>However they have writ the style of gods<br>And made a push at chance and sufferance.
LEONATO	5	1	2190	2191	2	16	Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.<br>Make those that do offend you suffer too.
LEONATO	5	1	2192	2195	4	34	There thou speak’st reason. Nay, I will do so.<br>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,<br>And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince<br>And all of them that thus dishonor her.
LEONATO	5	1	2196	2196	1	7	Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
LEONATO	5	1	2199	2199	1	4	Hear you, my lords—
LEONATO	5	1	2202	2203	2	19	Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord.<br>Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.
LEONATO	5	1	2205	2206	2	13	If he could right himself with quarrelling,<br>Some of us would lie low.
LEONATO	5	1	2208	2210	3	20	Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.<br>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.<br>I fear thee not.
LEONATO	5	1	2214	2228	15	119	Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.<br>I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,<br>As under privilege of age to brag<br>What I have done being young, or what would do<br>Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<br>Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me<br>That I am forced to lay my reverence by,<br>And with gray hairs and bruise of many days<br>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<br>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child.<br>Thy slander hath gone through and through her<br>heart,<br>And she lies buried with her ancestors,<br>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,<br>Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy.
LEONATO	5	1	2230	2230	1	5	Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.
LEONATO	5	1	2232	2235	4	29	My lord, my lord,<br>I’ll prove it on his body if he dare,<br>Despite his nice fence and his active practice,<br>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
LEONATO	5	1	2237	2238	2	20	Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast killed my child.<br>If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
LEONATO	5	1	2239	2245	7	54	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed,<br>But that’s no matter. Let him kill one first.<br>Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.—<br>Come, follow me, boy. Come, sir boy, come, follow<br>me.<br>Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence,<br>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
LEONATO	5	1	2246	2246	1	1	Brother—
LEONATO	5	1	2247	2251	5	39	Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,<br>And she is dead, slandered to death by villains<br>That dare as well answer a man indeed<br>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.—<br>Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
LEONATO	5	1	2252	2252	1	2	Brother Anthony—
LEONATO	5	1	2253	2260	8	58	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,<br>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple—<br>Scambling, outfacing, fashionmonging boys,<br>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<br>Go anticly and show outward hideousness,<br>And speak off half a dozen dang’rous words<br>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst,<br>And this is all.
LEONATO	5	1	2261	2261	1	3	But brother Anthony—
LEONATO	5	1	2262	2263	2	13	Come, ’tis no matter.<br>Do not you meddle. Let me deal in this.
LEONATO	5	1	2268	2268	1	4	My lord, my lord—
LEONATO	5	1	2270	2270	1	8	No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.
LEONATO	5	1	2271	2271	1	10	And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
LEONATO	5	1	2419	2421	3	26	Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,<br>That, when I note another man like him,<br>I may avoid him. Which of these is he?
LEONATO	5	1	2423	2424	2	13	Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed<br>Mine innocent child?
LEONATO	5	1	2426	2431	6	49	No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.<br>Here stand a pair of honorable men—<br>A third is fled—that had a hand in it.—<br>I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death.<br>Record it with your high and worthy deeds.<br>’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
LEONATO	5	1	2441	2454	14	108	I cannot bid you bid my daughter live—<br>That were impossible—but, I pray you both,<br>Possess the people in Messina here<br>How innocent she died. And if your love<br>Can labor aught in sad invention,<br>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb<br>And sing it to her bones. Sing it tonight.<br>Tomorrow morning come you to my house,<br>And since you could not be my son-in-law,<br>Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,<br>Almost the copy of my child that’s dead,<br>And she alone is heir to both of us.<br>Give her the right you should have giv’n her cousin,<br>And so dies my revenge.
LEONATO	5	1	2459	2463	5	38	Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.<br>Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man<br>Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,<br>Who I believe was packed in all this wrong,<br>Hired to it by your brother.
LEONATO	5	1	2478	2478	1	9	I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
LEONATO	5	1	2481	2481	1	4	There’s for thy pains.
LEONATO	5	1	2483	2484	2	11	Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I<br>thank thee.
LEONATO	5	1	2492	2492	1	5	Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
LEONATO	5	1	2493	2493	1	8	Farewell, my lords. We look for you tomorrow.
LEONATO	5	1	2496	2498	3	17	Bring you these fellows on.—We’ll talk with<br>Margaret,<br>How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
LEONATO	5	4	2636	2640	5	39	So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her<br>Upon the error that you heard debated.<br>But Margaret was in some fault for this,<br>Although against her will, as it appears<br>In the true course of all the question.
LEONATO	5	4	2641	2641	1	10	Well, I am glad that all things sorts so well.
LEONATO	5	4	2644	2650	7	51	Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,<br>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,<br>And when I send for you, come hither masked.<br>The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour<br>To visit me.—You know your office, brother.<br>You must be father to your brother’s daughter,<br>And give her to young Claudio.
LEONATO	5	4	2651	2651	1	7	Which I will do with confirmed countenance.
LEONATO	5	4	2657	2657	1	9	That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.
LEONATO	5	4	2659	2660	2	18	The sight whereof I think you had from me,<br>From Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?
LEONATO	5	4	2666	2666	1	6	My heart is with your liking.
LEONATO	5	4	2670	2672	3	21	Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio.<br>We here attend you. Are you yet determined<br>Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?
LEONATO	5	4	2674	2674	1	8	Call her forth, brother. Here’s the Friar ready.
LEONATO	5	4	2689	2689	1	10	This same is she, and I do give you her.
LEONATO	5	4	2691	2692	2	18	No, that you shall not till you take her hand<br>Before this friar and swear to marry her.
LEONATO	5	4	2702	2702	1	9	She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
LEONATO	5	4	2722	2722	1	9	Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
LEONATO	5	4	2758	2758	1	4	We’ll have dancing afterward.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	1	2	326	328	3	20	He is very busy about it. But,<br>brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet<br>dreamt not of.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	1	2	330	339	10	82	As the events stamps them, but<br>they have a good cover; they show well outward.<br>The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached<br>alley in mine orchard, were thus much<br>overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered<br>to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and<br>meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if<br>he found her accordant, he meant to take the<br>present time by the top and instantly break with you<br>of it.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	1	2	341	342	2	13	A good sharp fellow. I will send<br>for him, and question him yourself.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	2	1	425	425	1	4	I saw him not.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	2	1	443	443	1	5	In faith, she’s too curst.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	2	1	473	474	2	11	Well, niece, I trust you<br>will be ruled by your father.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2150	2152	3	19	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,<br>And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief<br>Against yourself.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2184	2184	1	7	Therein do men from children nothing differ.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2190	2191	2	16	Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.<br>Make those that do offend you suffer too.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2196	2196	1	7	Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2205	2206	2	13	If he could right himself with quarrelling,<br>Some of us would lie low.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2239	2245	7	54	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed,<br>But that’s no matter. Let him kill one first.<br>Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.—<br>Come, follow me, boy. Come, sir boy, come, follow<br>me.<br>Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence,<br>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2247	2251	5	39	Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,<br>And she is dead, slandered to death by villains<br>That dare as well answer a man indeed<br>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.—<br>Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2253	2260	8	58	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,<br>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple—<br>Scambling, outfacing, fashionmonging boys,<br>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<br>Go anticly and show outward hideousness,<br>And speak off half a dozen dang’rous words<br>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst,<br>And this is all.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2262	2263	2	13	Come, ’tis no matter.<br>Do not you meddle. Let me deal in this.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2271	2271	1	10	And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	1	2493	2493	1	8	Farewell, my lords. We look for you tomorrow.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	4	2641	2641	1	10	Well, I am glad that all things sorts so well.
LEONATOS_BROTHER	5	4	2651	2651	1	7	Which I will do with confirmed countenance.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	12	17	6	49	Much deserved on his part, and equally<br>remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself<br>beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure<br>of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better<br>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<br>tell you how.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	20	23	4	29	I have already delivered him letters, and<br>there appears much joy in him, even so much that<br>joy could not show itself modest enough without a<br>badge of bitterness.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	25	25	1	3	In great measure.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	3	4	2	16	He is very near by this. He was not three<br>leagues off when I left him.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	32	33	2	17	I know none of that name, lady. There<br>was none such in the army of any sort.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	36	37	2	10	O, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever<br>he was.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	47	48	2	9	He hath done good service, lady, in these<br>wars.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	52	52	1	6	And a good soldier too, lady.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	55	56	2	15	A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed<br>with all honorable virtues.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	7	7	1	9	But few of any sort, and none of name.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	72	72	1	3	Is ’t possible?
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	76	77	2	10	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your<br>books.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	82	83	2	11	He is most in the company of the right<br>noble Claudio.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	89	89	1	7	I will hold friends with you, lady.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	1	1	93	93	1	4	Don Pedro is approached.
LEONATOS_MESSENGER	3	5	1700	1701	2	13	My lord, they stay for you to give your<br>daughter to her husband.
MARGARET-ADO	2	1	522	523	2	14	So would not I for your own sake, for I have<br>many ill qualities.
MARGARET-ADO	2	1	525	525	1	5	I say my prayers aloud.
MARGARET-ADO	2	1	528	528	1	7	God match me with a good dancer.
MARGARET-ADO	2	1	530	531	2	15	And God keep him out of my sight when the<br>dance is done. Answer, clerk.
MARGARET-ADO	3	1	1137	1137	1	8	I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1558	1559	2	8	Troth, I think your other rebato were<br>better.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1561	1562	2	15	By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant<br>your cousin will say so.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1565	1568	4	34	I like the new tire within excellently, if the<br>hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a<br>most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of<br>Milan’s gown that they praise so.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1570	1575	6	50	By my troth, ’s but a nightgown in respect<br>of yours—cloth o’ gold, and cuts, and laced with<br>silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,<br>and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel.<br>But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion,<br>yours is worth ten on ’t.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1578	1579	2	10	’Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a<br>man.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1581	1589	10	80	Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is<br>not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your<br>lord honorable without marriage? I think you<br>would have me say <span class="quote" data-words="5">Saving your reverence, a husband.</span><br>An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking,<br>I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in <span class="quote" data-words="5">the heavierfor a husband</span>? None, I think, an it be the right<br>husband and the right wife. Otherwise, ’tis light and<br>not heavy. Ask my lady Beatrice else. Here she<br>comes.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1595	1596	2	19	Clap ’s into Light o’ love. That goes<br>without a burden. Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1600	1601	2	9	O, illegitimate construction! I scorn that<br>with my heels.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1605	1605	1	8	For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1607	1608	2	14	Well, an you be not turned Turk, there’s no<br>more sailing by the star.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1610	1611	2	9	Nothing, I; but God send everyone their<br>heart’s desire.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1615	1616	2	9	A maid, and stuffed! There’s goodly catching<br>of cold.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1619	1620	2	12	Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit<br>become me rarely?
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1623	1625	3	22	Get you some of this distilled <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">carduus benedictus</span><br>and lay it to your heart. It is the only thing for<br>a qualm.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1629	1641	13	135	Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral<br>meaning; I meant plain holy thistle. You may think<br>perchance that I think you are in love. Nay, by ’r<br>Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I<br>list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot<br>think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that<br>you are in love or that you will be in love or that you<br>can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and<br>now is he become a man. He swore he would never<br>marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats<br>his meat without grudging. And how you may be<br>converted I know not, but methinks you look with<br>your eyes as other women do.
MARGARET-ADO	3	4	1643	1643	1	4	Not a false gallop.
MARGARET-ADO	5	2	2502	2503	2	12	Will you then write me a sonnet in praise<br>of my beauty?
MARGARET-ADO	5	2	2507	2508	2	14	To have no man come over me? Why, shall I<br>always keep below stairs?
MARGARET-ADO	5	2	2511	2512	2	13	And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils,<br>which hit but hurt not.
MARGARET-ADO	5	2	2516	2517	2	10	Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our<br>own.
MARGARET-ADO	5	2	2521	2522	2	12	Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I<br>think hath legs.
SEACOAL	3	3	1388	1388	1	4	Both which, master constable—
SEACOAL	3	3	1398	1398	1	6	How if he will not stand?
SEACOAL	3	3	1415	1415	1	5	How if they will not?
SEACOAL	3	3	1419	1419	1	2	Well, sir.
SEACOAL	3	3	1424	1425	2	15	If we know him to be a thief, shall we not<br>lay hands on him?
SEACOAL	3	3	1458	1460	3	22	Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go<br>sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all<br>to bed.
SEACOAL	3	3	1466	1466	1	3	Peace, stir not.
SEACOAL	3	3	1476	1477	2	6	Some treason, masters. Yet stand<br>close.
SEACOAL	3	3	1538	1541	4	26	Call up the right Master Constable.<br>We have here recovered the most<br>dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in<br>the commonwealth.
SEACOAL	4	2	2109	2111	3	17	Marry, that he had received a thousand<br>ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero<br>wrongfully.
SEACOAL	4	2	2121	2121	1	3	This is all.
SECOND_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1408	1409	2	13	We will rather sleep than talk.<br>We know what belongs to a watch.
SECOND_WATCHMAN-ADO	3	3	1437	1438	2	11	How if the nurse be asleep and<br>will not hear us?
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2063	2063	1	4	Which be the malefactors?
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2067	2069	3	16	But which are the offenders that are to be<br>examined? Let them come before Master<br>Constable.
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2095	2097	3	19	Master constable, you go not the way to<br>examine. You must call forth the watch that are<br>their accusers.
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2108	2108	1	6	What heard you him say else?
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2114	2114	1	3	What else, fellow?
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2120	2120	1	2	What else?
SEXTON-ADO	4	2	2122	2128	7	58	And this is more, masters, than you can deny.<br>Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.<br>Hero was in this manner accused, in this very<br>manner refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly<br>died.—Master constable, let these men be bound<br>and brought to Leonato’s. I will go before and show<br>him their examination.
URSULA-ADO	2	1	533	534	2	9	I know you well enough. You are Signior<br>Antonio.
URSULA-ADO	2	1	536	536	1	9	I know you by the waggling of your head.
URSULA-ADO	2	1	538	540	3	26	You could never do him so ill-well unless you<br>were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and<br>down. You are he, you are he.
URSULA-ADO	2	1	542	545	4	31	Come, come, do you think I do not know you<br>by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to,<br>mum, you are he. Graces will appear, and there’s an<br>end.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1149	1154	6	44	The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish<br>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream<br>And greedily devour the treacherous bait.<br>So angle we for Beatrice, who even now<br>Is couchèd in the woodbine coverture.<br>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1160	1161	2	10	But are you sure<br>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1163	1163	1	10	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1168	1170	3	21	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman<br>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed<br>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1181	1183	3	21	Sure, I think so,<br>And therefore certainly it were not good<br>She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1197	1197	1	7	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1208	1208	1	10	Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1214	1218	5	40	O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!<br>She cannot be so much without true judgment,<br>Having so swift and excellent a wit<br>As she is prized to have, as to refuse<br>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1221	1224	4	27	I pray you be not angry with me, madam,<br>Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,<br>For shape, for bearing, argument, and valor,<br>Goes foremost in report through Italy.
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1226	1227	2	14	His excellence did earn it ere he had it.<br>When are you married, madam?
URSULA-ADO	3	1	1231	1232	2	10	She’s limed, I warrant you. We have caught her,<br>madam.
URSULA-ADO	3	4	1555	1555	1	3	I will, lady.
URSULA-ADO	3	4	1557	1557	1	3	Well.
URSULA-ADO	3	4	1644	1646	3	24	Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count,<br>Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of<br>the town are come to fetch you to church.
URSULA-ADO	5	2	2593	2597	5	45	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder’s<br>old coil at home. It is proved my Lady Hero<br>hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio<br>mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all,<br>who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?
VERGES	3	3	1373	1374	2	14	Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer<br>salvation, body and soul.
VERGES	3	3	1378	1379	2	7	Well, give them their charge, neighbor<br>Dogberry.
VERGES	3	3	1402	1403	2	16	If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is<br>none of the Prince’s subjects.
VERGES	3	3	1431	1432	2	9	You have been always called a merciful man,<br>partner.
VERGES	3	3	1435	1436	2	20	If you hear a child cry in the<br>night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.
VERGES	3	3	1443	1443	1	3	’Tis very true.
VERGES	3	3	1447	1447	1	9	Nay, by ’r Lady, that I think he cannot.
VERGES	3	3	1453	1453	1	8	By ’r Lady, I think it be so.
VERGES	3	5	1655	1655	1	6	Yes, in truth, it is, sir.
VERGES	3	5	1661	1662	2	22	Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man<br>living that is an old man and no honester than I.
VERGES	3	5	1675	1675	1	4	And so am I.
VERGES	3	5	1677	1679	3	21	Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your<br>Worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant<br>knaves as any in Messina.
VERGES	3	5	1706	1706	1	6	And we must do it wisely.
VERGES	4	2	2062	2062	1	9	O, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.
VERGES	4	2	2065	2066	2	9	Nay, that’s certain, we have the exhibition to<br>examine.
VERGES	4	2	2113	2113	1	6	Yea, by Mass, that it is.
VERGES	4	2	2130	2130	1	6	Let them be in the hands—
VERGES	5	1	2417	2418	2	10	Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato,<br>and the Sexton too.
