BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2339	2339	1	4	’Save you, friend Cassio!
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2344	2348	5	34	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<br>What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,<br>Eightscore eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours<br>More tedious than the dial eightscore times?<br>O weary reck’ning!
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2354	2357	4	29	O, Cassio, whence came this?<br>This is some token from a newer friend.<br>To the felt absence now I feel a cause.<br>Is ’t come to this? Well, well.
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2364	2364	1	4	Why, whose is it?
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2369	2369	1	3	Leave you? Wherefore?
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2373	2373	1	4	Why, I pray you?
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2375	2377	3	27	But that you do not love me!<br>I pray you bring me on the way a little,<br>And say if I shall see you soon at night.
BIANCA-OTH	3	4	2380	2380	1	7	’Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.
BIANCA-OTH	4	1	2547	2554	8	83	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did<br>you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me<br>even now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take<br>out the work? A likely piece of work, that you<br>should find it in your chamber and know not who<br>left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must<br>take out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.<br>Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.
BIANCA-OTH	4	1	2557	2559	3	19	If you’ll come to supper tonight you may. If<br>you will not, come when you are next prepared<br>for.
BIANCA-OTH	5	1	3183	3183	1	10	What is the matter, ho? Who is ’t that cried?
BIANCA-OTH	5	1	3185	3186	2	11	O, my dear Cassio,<br>My sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
BIANCA-OTH	5	1	3193	3193	1	7	Alas, he faints. O, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
BIANCA-OTH	5	1	3235	3235	1	10	He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.
BIANCA-OTH	5	1	3238	3239	2	15	I am no strumpet, but of life as honest<br>As you that thus abuse me.
BRABANTIO	1	1	102	102	1	6	What, have you lost your wits?
BRABANTIO	1	1	104	104	1	5	Not I. What are you?
BRABANTIO	1	1	106	112	7	48	The worser welcome.<br>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.<br>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br>My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,<br>Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts,<br>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come<br>To start my quiet.
BRABANTIO	1	1	114	116	3	21	But thou must needs be sure<br>My spirit and my place have in them power<br>To make this bitter to thee.
BRABANTIO	1	1	118	119	2	15	What tell’st thou me of robbing?<br>This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
BRABANTIO	1	1	128	128	1	5	What profane wretch art thou?
BRABANTIO	1	1	132	132	1	4	Thou art a villain.
BRABANTIO	1	1	134	134	1	8	This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
BRABANTIO	1	1	156	160	5	31	Strike on the tinder, ho!<br>Give me a taper. Call up all my people.<br>This accident is not unlike my dream.<br>Belief of it oppresses me already.<br>Light, I say, light!
BRABANTIO	1	1	178	189	12	70	It is too true an evil. Gone she is,<br>And what’s to come of my despisèd time<br>Is naught but bitterness.—Now, Roderigo,<br>Where didst thou see her?—O, unhappy girl!—<br>With the Moor, sayst thou?—Who would be a<br>father?—<br>How didst thou know ’twas she?—O, she deceives<br>me<br>Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more<br>tapers.<br>Raise all my kindred.—Are they married, think<br>you?
BRABANTIO	1	1	191	196	6	49	O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds<br>By what you see them act.—Is there not charms<br>By which the property of youth and maidhood<br>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br>Of some such thing?
BRABANTIO	1	1	198	200	3	26	Call up my brother.—O, would you had had her!—<br>Some one way, some another.—Do you know<br>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
BRABANTIO	1	1	203	206	4	32	Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call.<br>I may command at most.—Get weapons, ho!<br>And raise some special officers of night.—<br>On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.
BRABANTIO	1	1	89	90	2	13	What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br>What is the matter there?
BRABANTIO	1	1	93	93	1	5	Why, wherefore ask you this?
BRABANTIO	1	2	279	280	2	4	Down with him,<br>thief!
BRABANTIO	1	2	286	306	21	161	O, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my<br>daughter?<br>Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!<br>For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,<br>If she in chains of magic were not bound,<br>Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,<br>So opposite to marriage that she shunned<br>The wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation,<br>Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock,<br>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br>Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight!<br>Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense<br>That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,<br>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br>That weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed on.<br>’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.<br>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br>For an abuser of the world, a practicer<br>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.—<br>Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,<br>Subdue him at his peril.
BRABANTIO	1	2	312	314	3	16	To prison, till fit time<br>Of law and course of direct session<br>Call thee to answer.
BRABANTIO	1	2	323	329	7	54	How? The Duke in council?<br>In this time of the night? Bring him away;<br>Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,<br>Or any of my brothers of the state,<br>Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.<br>For if such actions may have passage free,<br>Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
BRABANTIO	1	3	390	397	8	56	So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me.<br>Neither my place nor aught I heard of business<br>Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general<br>care<br>Take hold on me, for my particular grief<br>Is of so floodgate and o’erbearing nature<br>That it engluts and swallows other sorrows<br>And it is still itself.
BRABANTIO	1	3	399	399	1	5	My daughter! O, my daughter!
BRABANTIO	1	3	401	406	6	36	Ay, to me.<br>She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted<br>By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<br>For nature so prepost’rously to err—<br>Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense—<br>Sans witchcraft could not.
BRABANTIO	1	3	413	416	4	25	Humbly I thank your Grace.<br>Here is the man—this Moor, whom now it seems<br>Your special mandate for the state affairs<br>Hath hither brought.
BRABANTIO	1	3	419	419	1	5	Nothing, but this is so.
BRABANTIO	1	3	441	453	13	98	A maiden never bold,<br>Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion<br>Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,<br>Of years, of country, credit, everything,<br>To fall in love with what she feared to look on!<br>It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect<br>That will confess perfection so could err<br>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br>To find out practices of cunning hell<br>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again<br>That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,<br>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,<br>He wrought upon her.
BRABANTIO	1	3	531	536	6	44	I pray you hear her speak.<br>If she confess that she was half the wooer,<br>Destruction on my head if my bad blame<br>Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress.<br>Do you perceive in all this noble company<br>Where most you owe obedience?
BRABANTIO	1	3	548	557	10	84	God be with you! I have done.<br>Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs.<br>I had rather to adopt a child than get it.—<br>Come hither, Moor.<br>I here do give thee that with all my heart<br>Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<br>I would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,<br>I am glad at soul I have no other child,<br>For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<br>To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.
BRABANTIO	1	3	570	582	13	95	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,<br>We lose it not so long as we can smile.<br>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears<br>But the free comfort which from thence he hears;<br>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br>These sentences to sugar or to gall,<br>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.<br>But words are words. I never yet did hear<br>That the bruised heart was piercèd through the<br>ear.<br>I humbly beseech you, proceed to th’ affairs of<br>state.
BRABANTIO	1	3	603	603	1	6	I will not have it so.
BRABANTIO	1	3	662	663	2	18	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.<br>She has deceived her father, and may thee.
CASSIO	1	2	248	250	3	16	The Duke does greet you, general,<br>And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,<br>Even on the instant.
CASSIO	1	2	252	261	10	69	Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.<br>It is a business of some heat. The galleys<br>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<br>This very night at one another’s heels,<br>And many of the Consuls, raised and met,<br>Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly<br>called for.<br>When, being not at your lodging to be found,<br>The Senate hath sent about three several quests<br>To search you out.
CASSIO	1	2	265	265	1	5	Ancient, what makes he here?
CASSIO	1	2	268	268	1	4	I do not understand.
CASSIO	1	2	270	270	1	2	To who?
CASSIO	1	2	274	274	1	8	Here comes another troop to seek for you.
CASSIO	2	1	824	827	4	32	Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,<br>That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens<br>Give him defense against the elements,<br>For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
CASSIO	2	1	829	832	4	25	His bark is stoutly timbered, and his pilot<br>Of very expert and approved allowance;<br>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,<br>Stand in bold cure.
CASSIO	2	1	833	833	1	2	What noise?
CASSIO	2	1	836	836	1	8	My hopes do shape him for the Governor.
CASSIO	2	1	839	840	2	15	I pray you, sir, go forth,<br>And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.
CASSIO	2	1	843	848	6	41	Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid<br>That paragons description and wild fame,<br>One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,<br>And in th’ essential vesture of creation<br>Does tire the ingener.<br>How now? Who has put in?
CASSIO	2	1	850	856	7	44	’Has had most favorable and happy speed!<br>Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,<br>The guttered rocks and congregated sands<br>(Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel),<br>As having sense of beauty, do omit<br>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by<br>The divine Desdemona.
CASSIO	2	1	858	872	15	115	She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,<br>Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<br>Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts<br>A sennight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,<br>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,<br>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,<br>Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,<br>Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits,<br>And bring all Cyprus comfort!<br>O, behold,<br>The riches of the ship is come on shore!<br>You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.<br>Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven,<br>Before, behind thee, and on every hand<br>Enwheel thee round.
CASSIO	2	1	875	876	2	18	He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught<br>But that he’s well and will be shortly here.
CASSIO	2	1	878	880	3	21	The great contention of sea and skies<br>Parted our fellowship.<br>But hark, a sail!
CASSIO	2	1	883	887	5	41	See for the news.<br>Good ancient, you are welcome. Welcome, mistress.<br>Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<br>That I extend my manners. ’Tis my breeding<br>That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
CASSIO	2	1	956	957	2	16	He speaks home, madam. You may relish him<br>more in the soldier than in the scholar.
CASSIO	2	1	970	970	1	3	’Tis truly so.
CASSIO	2	1	972	972	1	4	Lo, where he comes!
CASSIO	2	3	1126	1128	3	17	Iago hath direction what to do,<br>But notwithstanding, with my personal eye<br>Will I look to ’t.
CASSIO	2	3	1136	1136	1	7	Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.
CASSIO	2	3	1142	1142	1	5	She’s a most exquisite lady.
CASSIO	2	3	1144	1145	2	8	Indeed, she’s a most fresh and delicate<br>creature.
CASSIO	2	3	1148	1149	2	8	An inviting eye, and yet methinks right<br>modest.
CASSIO	2	3	1151	1151	1	4	She is indeed perfection.
CASSIO	2	3	1156	1159	4	25	Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and<br>unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish<br>courtesy would invent some other custom of<br>entertainment.
CASSIO	2	3	1162	1165	4	35	I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was<br>craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it<br>makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and<br>dare not task my weakness with any more.
CASSIO	2	3	1168	1168	1	3	Where are they?
CASSIO	2	3	1170	1170	1	7	I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.
CASSIO	2	3	1189	1190	2	9	’Fore God, they have given me a rouse<br>already.
CASSIO	2	3	1200	1200	1	5	’Fore God, an excellent song.
CASSIO	2	3	1205	1206	2	8	Is your Englishman so exquisite in his<br>drinking?
CASSIO	2	3	1211	1211	1	6	To the health of our general!
CASSIO	2	3	1224	1225	2	11	’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than<br>the other!
CASSIO	2	3	1227	1230	4	34	No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place<br>that does those things. Well, God’s above all; and<br>there be souls must be saved, and there be souls<br>must not be saved.
CASSIO	2	3	1232	1233	2	19	For mine own part—no offense to the General,<br>nor any man of quality—I hope to be saved.
CASSIO	2	3	1235	1242	8	74	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The<br>Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let’s<br>have no more of this. Let’s to our affairs. God<br>forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our<br>business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This<br>is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my<br>left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,<br>and I speak well enough.
CASSIO	2	3	1244	1245	2	13	Why, very well then. You must not think then<br>that I am drunk.
CASSIO	2	3	1275	1275	1	5	Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!
CASSIO	2	3	1277	1278	2	14	A knave teach me my duty? I’ll beat the knave<br>into a twiggen bottle.
CASSIO	2	3	1280	1280	1	4	Dost thou prate, rogue?
CASSIO	2	3	1283	1284	2	11	Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the<br>mazard.
CASSIO	2	3	1286	1286	1	1	Drunk?
CASSIO	2	3	1323	1323	1	8	I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.
CASSIO	2	3	1401	1401	1	4	Ay, past all surgery.
CASSIO	2	3	1403	1406	4	27	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have<br>lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of<br>myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,<br>Iago, my reputation!
CASSIO	2	3	1418	1424	7	59	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive<br>so good a commander with so slight, so drunken,<br>and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak<br>parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse<br>fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou<br>invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be<br>known by, let us call thee devil!
CASSIO	2	3	1427	1427	1	3	I know not.
CASSIO	2	3	1429	1434	6	43	I remember a mass of things, but nothing<br>distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O<br>God, that men should put an enemy in their<br>mouths to steal away their brains! That we should<br>with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform<br>ourselves into beasts!
CASSIO	2	3	1437	1439	3	24	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give<br>place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows<br>me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
CASSIO	2	3	1444	1449	6	58	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell<br>me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as<br>Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be<br>now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently<br>a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,<br>and the ingredient is a devil.
CASSIO	2	3	1453	1453	1	8	I have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!
CASSIO	2	3	1468	1468	1	4	You advise me well.
CASSIO	2	3	1471	1474	4	30	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I<br>will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake<br>for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check<br>me here.
CASSIO	2	3	1477	1477	1	4	Good night, honest Iago.
CASSIO	3	1	1533	1534	3	16	Masters, play here (I will content your pains)<br>Something that’s brief; and bid <span class="quote" data-words="3">Good morrow,general.</span>
CASSIO	3	1	1554	1554	1	6	Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?
CASSIO	3	1	1556	1560	5	41	Prithee, keep up thy quillets.<br>There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman<br>that attends the General’s wife be stirring,<br>tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favor<br>of speech. Wilt thou do this?
CASSIO	3	1	1563	1564	2	12	Do, good my friend.<br>In happy time, Iago.
CASSIO	3	1	1566	1570	5	35	Why, no. The day had broke<br>Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,<br>To send in to your wife. My suit to her<br>Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona<br>Procure me some access.
CASSIO	3	1	1575	1577	3	17	I humbly thank you for ’t.  I never<br>knew<br>A Florentine more kind and honest.
CASSIO	3	1	1589	1592	4	24	Yet I beseech you,<br>If you think fit, or that it may be done,<br>Give me advantage of some brief discourse<br>With Desdemon alone.
CASSIO	3	1	1596	1596	1	6	I am much bound to you.
CASSIO	3	3	1611	1613	3	15	Bounteous madam,<br>Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<br>He’s never anything but your true servant.
CASSIO	3	3	1618	1623	6	41	Ay, but, lady,<br>That policy may either last so long,<br>Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<br>Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<br>That, I being absent and my place supplied,<br>My general will forget my love and service.
CASSIO	3	3	1635	1635	1	5	Madam, I’ll take my leave.
CASSIO	3	3	1637	1638	2	14	Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,<br>Unfit for mine own purposes.
CASSIO	3	4	2277	2289	13	96	Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you<br>That by your virtuous means I may again<br>Exist, and be a member of his love<br>Whom I with all the office of my heart<br>Entirely honor. I would not be delayed.<br>If my offense be of such mortal kind<br>That nor my service past nor present sorrows<br>Nor purposed merit in futurity<br>Can ransom me into his love again,<br>But to know so must be my benefit.<br>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<br>And shut myself up in some other course<br>To fortune’s alms.
CASSIO	3	4	2338	2338	1	5	I humbly thank your Ladyship.
CASSIO	3	4	2340	2343	4	24	What make you from<br>home?<br>How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?<br>I’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
CASSIO	3	4	2349	2353	5	37	Pardon me, Bianca.<br>I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed,<br>But I shall in a more continuate time<br>Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,<br>Take me this work out.
CASSIO	3	4	2358	2363	6	33	Go to, woman!<br>Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,<br>From whence you have them. You are jealous now<br>That this is from some mistress, some<br>remembrance.<br>No, by my faith, Bianca.
CASSIO	3	4	2365	2368	4	40	I know not neither. I found it in my chamber.<br>I like the work well. Ere it be demanded,<br>As like enough it will, I would have it copied.<br>Take it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.
CASSIO	3	4	2370	2372	3	21	I do attend here on the General,<br>And think it no addition, nor my wish,<br>To have him see me womaned.
CASSIO	3	4	2374	2374	1	6	Not that I love you not.
CASSIO	3	4	2378	2379	2	19	’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,<br>For I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.
CASSIO	4	1	2440	2440	1	3	What’s the matter?
CASSIO	4	1	2443	2443	1	5	Rub him about the temples.
CASSIO	4	1	2501	2502	2	13	The worser that you give me the addition<br>Whose want even kills me.
CASSIO	4	1	2506	2506	1	3	Alas, poor caitiff!
CASSIO	4	1	2509	2509	1	10	Alas, poor rogue, I think i’ faith she loves me.
CASSIO	4	1	2516	2516	1	3	Ha, ha, ha!
CASSIO	4	1	2518	2520	3	22	I marry her? What, a customer? Prithee bear<br>some charity to my wit! Do not think it so unwholesome.<br>Ha, ha, ha!
CASSIO	4	1	2523	2523	1	3	Prithee say true!
CASSIO	4	1	2526	2528	3	26	This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is<br>persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and<br>flattery, not out of my promise.
CASSIO	4	1	2530	2534	5	37	She was here even now. She haunts me in<br>every place. I was the other day talking on the<br>sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes<br>the bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my<br>neck!
CASSIO	4	1	2537	2538	2	16	So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so<br>shakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!
CASSIO	4	1	2542	2542	1	6	Well, I must leave her company.
CASSIO	4	1	2544	2546	3	17	’Tis such another fitchew—marry, a perfumed<br>one!—What do you mean by this haunting<br>of me?
CASSIO	4	1	2555	2555	1	9	How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?
CASSIO	4	1	2561	2561	1	9	Faith, I must. She’ll rail in the streets else.
CASSIO	4	1	2563	2563	1	4	Faith, I intend so.
CASSIO	4	1	2566	2566	1	4	Prithee come. Will you?
CASSIO	5	1	3120	3122	3	22	That thrust had been mine enemy indeed<br>But that my coat is better than thou know’st.<br>I will make proof of thine.
CASSIO	5	1	3124	3124	1	8	I am maimed forever! Help, ho! Murder, murder!
CASSIO	5	1	3128	3128	1	6	O, help ho! Light! A surgeon!
CASSIO	5	1	3137	3137	1	8	What ho! No watch? No passage? Murder, murder!
CASSIO	5	1	3139	3139	1	2	O, help!
CASSIO	5	1	3153	3153	1	7	Here, here! For heaven’s sake, help me!
CASSIO	5	1	3158	3159	2	12	Iago? O, I am spoiled, undone by villains.<br>Give me some help!
CASSIO	5	1	3161	3162	2	12	I think that one of them is hereabout<br>And cannot make away.
CASSIO	5	1	3167	3167	1	4	That’s one of them.
CASSIO	5	1	3180	3180	1	6	My leg is cut in two.
CASSIO	5	1	3189	3189	1	1	No.
CASSIO	5	1	3217	3217	1	10	None in the world. Nor do I know the man.
CASSIO	5	2	3597	3597	1	7	Dear general, I never gave you cause.
CASSIO	5	2	3615	3615	1	5	Most heathenish and most gross.
CASSIO	5	2	3624	3627	4	28	I found it in my chamber.<br>And he himself confessed it but even now,<br>That there he dropped it for a special purpose<br>Which wrought to his desire.
CASSIO	5	2	3629	3634	6	43	There is besides, in Roderigo’s letter,<br>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br>Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came<br>That I was cast. And even but now he spake,<br>After long seeming dead: Iago hurt him,<br>Iago set him on.
CASSIO	5	2	3668	3669	2	16	This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,<br>For he was great of heart.
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1536	1537	2	15	Why masters, have your instruments been in<br>Naples, that they speak i’ th’ nose thus?
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1539	1539	1	7	Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1541	1541	1	5	O, thereby hangs a tail.
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1543	1546	4	37	Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I<br>know. But, masters, here’s money for you; and the<br>General so likes your music that he desires you, for<br>love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1548	1550	3	26	If you have any music that may not be heard, to<br>’t again. But, as they say, to hear music the General<br>does not greatly care.
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1552	1553	2	16	Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll<br>away. Go, vanish into air, away!
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1555	1555	1	10	No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.
CLOWN-OTH	3	1	1561	1562	2	16	She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall<br>seem to notify unto her.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2152	2152	1	7	I dare not say he lies anywhere.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2154	2155	2	13	He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies,<br>’tis stabbing.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2157	2158	2	13	To tell you where he lodges is to tell you<br>where I lie.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2160	2162	3	29	I know not where he lodges; and for me to<br>devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies<br>there, were to lie in mine own throat.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2165	2166	2	15	I will catechize the world for him—that is,<br>make questions, and by them answer.
CLOWN-OTH	3	4	2170	2171	2	18	To do this is within the compass of man’s wit,<br>and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
DESDEMONA	1	3	537	547	11	75	My noble father,<br>I do perceive here a divided duty.<br>To you I am bound for life and education.<br>My life and education both do learn me<br>How to respect you. You are the lord of duty.<br>I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my<br>husband.<br>And so much duty as my mother showed<br>To you, preferring you before her father,<br>So much I challenge that I may profess<br>Due to the Moor my lord.
DESDEMONA	1	3	605	610	6	40	Nor would I there reside<br>To put my father in impatient thoughts<br>By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<br>To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear<br>And let me find a charter in your voice<br>T’ assist my simpleness.
DESDEMONA	1	3	612	623	12	100	That I did love the Moor to live with him<br>My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br>May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued<br>Even to the very quality of my lord.<br>I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,<br>And to his honors and his valiant parts<br>Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br>So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br>A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br>The rites for why I love him are bereft me<br>And I a heavy interim shall support<br>By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
DESDEMONA	2	1	873	874	2	13	I thank you, valiant Cassio.<br>What tidings can you tell of my lord?
DESDEMONA	2	1	877	877	1	8	O, but I fear—How lost you company?
DESDEMONA	2	1	891	891	1	5	Alas, she has no speech!
DESDEMONA	2	1	902	902	1	5	Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer.
DESDEMONA	2	1	907	908	2	10	What wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise<br>me?
DESDEMONA	2	1	911	911	1	9	Come on, assay.—There’s one gone to the harbor?
DESDEMONA	2	1	913	915	3	21	I am not merry, but I do beguile<br>The thing I am by seeming otherwise.—<br>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
DESDEMONA	2	1	922	922	1	9	Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
DESDEMONA	2	1	925	925	1	3	Worse and worse.
DESDEMONA	2	1	929	931	3	23	These are old fond paradoxes to make<br>fools laugh i’ th’ alehouse. What miserable praise<br>hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?
DESDEMONA	2	1	934	938	5	37	O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the<br>worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on<br>a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority<br>of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very<br>malice itself?
DESDEMONA	2	1	950	950	1	3	To do what?
DESDEMONA	2	1	952	955	4	30	O, most lame and impotent conclusion!<br>—Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy<br>husband.—How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most<br>profane and liberal counselor?
DESDEMONA	2	1	971	971	1	6	Let’s meet him and receive him.
DESDEMONA	2	1	974	974	1	3	My dear Othello!
DESDEMONA	2	1	986	988	3	17	The heavens forbid<br>But that our loves and comforts should increase<br>Even as our days do grow!
DESDEMONA	2	3	1390	1390	1	5	What is the matter, dear?
DESDEMONA	3	3	1604	1605	2	14	Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do<br>All my abilities in thy behalf.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1608	1610	3	23	O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,<br>But I will have my lord and you again<br>As friendly as you were.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1614	1617	4	34	I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord;<br>You have known him long; and be you well assured<br>He shall in strangeness stand no farther off<br>Than in a politic distance.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1624	1633	10	77	Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here,<br>I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,<br>If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it<br>To the last article. My lord shall never rest:<br>I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;<br>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<br>I’ll intermingle everything he does<br>With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,<br>For thy solicitor shall rather die<br>Than give thy cause away.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1636	1636	1	6	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1639	1639	1	4	Well, do your discretion.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1648	1650	3	19	How now, my lord?<br>I have been talking with a suitor here,<br>A man that languishes in your displeasure.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1652	1658	7	52	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br>If I have any grace or power to move you,<br>His present reconciliation take;<br>For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br>I have no judgment in an honest face.<br>I prithee call him back.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1660	1662	3	23	Yes, faith, so humbled<br>That he hath left part of his grief with me<br>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1664	1664	1	5	But shall ’t be shortly?
DESDEMONA	3	3	1666	1666	1	6	Shall ’t be tonight at supper?
DESDEMONA	3	3	1668	1668	1	3	Tomorrow dinner, then?
DESDEMONA	3	3	1671	1685	15	129	Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,<br>On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.<br>I prithee name the time, but let it not<br>Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;<br>And yet his trespass, in our common reason—<br>Save that, they say, the wars must make example<br>Out of her best—is not almost a fault<br>T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?<br>Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul<br>What you would ask me that I should deny,<br>Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio,<br>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br>Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do<br>To bring him in! By ’r Lady, I could do much—
DESDEMONA	3	3	1688	1695	8	65	Why, this is not a boon!<br>’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br>To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit<br>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,<br>And fearful to be granted.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1699	1699	1	8	Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1701	1702	2	14	Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you.<br>Whate’er you be, I am obedient.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1924	1926	3	18	How now, my dear Othello?<br>Your dinner, and the generous islanders<br>By you invited, do attend your presence.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1928	1928	1	10	Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?
DESDEMONA	3	3	1930	1932	3	20	Faith, that’s with watching. ’Twill away again.<br>Let me but bind it hard; within this hour<br>It will be well.
DESDEMONA	3	3	1936	1936	1	9	I am very sorry that you are not well.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2150	2151	2	8	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant<br>Cassio lies?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2153	2153	1	2	Why, man?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2156	2156	1	5	Go to! Where lodges he?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2159	2159	1	6	Can anything be made of this?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2163	2164	2	10	Can you inquire him out, and be edified<br>by report?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2167	2169	3	22	Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I<br>have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will<br>be well.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2172	2172	1	7	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2174	2178	5	40	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br>Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor<br>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br>As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br>To put him to ill thinking.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2180	2181	2	16	Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br>Drew all such humors from him.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2184	2185	2	19	I will not leave him now till Cassio<br>Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2189	2189	1	4	Well, my good lord.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2192	2192	1	10	It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2200	2201	2	14	You may indeed say so,<br>For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2204	2204	1	9	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2206	2206	1	10	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2209	2209	1	3	Here, my lord.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2211	2211	1	6	I have it not about me.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2213	2213	1	4	No, faith, my lord.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2229	2229	1	3	Is ’t possible?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2237	2237	1	5	I’ faith, is ’t true?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2239	2239	1	10	Then would to God that I had never seen ’t!
DESDEMONA	3	4	2241	2241	1	8	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2243	2243	1	3	Heaven bless us!
DESDEMONA	3	4	2245	2245	1	10	It is not lost, but what an if it were?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2247	2247	1	6	I say it is not lost.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2249	2251	3	26	Why, so I can. But I will not now.<br>This is a trick to put me from my suit.<br>Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2254	2255	2	9	Come, come.<br>You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2257	2257	1	6	I pray, talk me of Cassio.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2259	2261	3	18	A man that all his time<br>Hath founded his good fortunes on your love;<br>Shared dangers with you—
DESDEMONA	3	4	2263	2263	1	6	I’ faith, you are to blame.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2266	2268	3	21	I ne’er saw this before.<br>Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief!<br>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2276	2276	1	9	How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?
DESDEMONA	3	4	2290	2299	10	80	Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,<br>My advocation is not now in tune.<br>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him<br>Were he in favor as in humor altered.<br>So help me every spirit sanctified<br>As I have spoken for you all my best,<br>And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.<br>What I can do I will; and more I will<br>Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2309	2324	16	115	I prithee do so.<br>Something, sure, of state,<br>Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice<br>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br>Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases<br>Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,<br>Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.<br>For let our finger ache, and it endues<br>Our other healthful members even to a sense<br>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,<br>Nor of them look for such observancy<br>As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br>I was—unhandsome warrior as I am!—<br>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul.<br>But now I find I had suborned the witness,<br>And he’s indicted falsely.
DESDEMONA	3	4	2328	2328	1	8	Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
DESDEMONA	3	4	2333	2333	1	7	Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!
DESDEMONA	3	4	2335	2337	3	26	I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.<br>If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit<br>And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2621	2621	1	7	And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?
DESDEMONA	4	1	2626	2627	2	17	Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord<br>An unkind breach, but you shall make all well.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2629	2629	1	2	My lord?
DESDEMONA	4	1	2634	2635	2	18	A most unhappy one. I would do much<br>T’ atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2637	2637	1	2	My lord?
DESDEMONA	4	1	2639	2639	1	4	What, is he angry?
DESDEMONA	4	1	2643	2643	1	8	By my troth, I am glad on ’t.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2645	2645	1	2	My lord?
DESDEMONA	4	1	2647	2647	1	3	Why, sweet Othello!
DESDEMONA	4	1	2649	2649	1	5	I have not deserved this.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2657	2657	1	11	I will not stay to offend you.
DESDEMONA	4	1	2661	2661	1	2	My lord?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2727	2727	1	6	My lord, what is your will?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2729	2730	2	4	What is your<br>pleasure?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2732	2732	1	4	What horrible fancy’s this?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2738	2740	3	19	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?<br>I understand a fury in your words,<br>But not the words.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2742	2742	1	9	Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2748	2748	1	5	Heaven doth truly know it.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2750	2750	1	10	To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2752	2757	6	47	Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?<br>Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?<br>If haply you my father do suspect<br>An instrument of this your calling back,<br>Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,<br>I have lost him too.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2776	2776	1	8	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2782	2782	1	7	Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2794	2794	1	6	By heaven, you do me wrong!
DESDEMONA	4	2	2796	2799	4	29	No, as I am a Christian!<br>If to preserve this vessel for my lord<br>From any other foul unlawful touch<br>Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2801	2801	1	6	No, as I shall be saved.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2803	2803	1	4	O, heaven forgive us!
DESDEMONA	4	2	2814	2814	1	3	Faith, half asleep.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2816	2816	1	2	With who?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2818	2818	1	4	Who is thy lord?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2820	2824	5	38	I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.<br>I cannot weep, nor answers have I none<br>But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight<br>Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.<br>And call thy husband hither.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2826	2828	3	25	’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.<br>How have I been behaved that he might stick<br>The small’st opinion on my least misuse?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2830	2833	4	33	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes<br>Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.<br>He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,<br>I am a child to chiding.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2838	2838	1	5	Am I that name, Iago?
DESDEMONA	4	2	2841	2841	1	10	Such as she said my lord did say I was.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2845	2845	1	11	I do not know. I am sure I am none such.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2851	2851	1	5	It is my wretched fortune.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2853	2853	1	4	Nay, heaven doth know.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2859	2859	1	8	If any such there be, heaven pardon him.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2876	2894	19	142	Alas, Iago,<br>What shall I do to win my lord again?<br>Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,<br>I know not how I lost him. Here I<br>kneel.<br>If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,<br>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<br>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense<br>Delighted them in any other form,<br>Or that I do not yet, and ever did,<br>And ever will—though he do shake me off<br>To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,<br>Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may<br>do much,<br>And his unkindness may defeat my life,<br>But never taint my love. I cannot say <span class="quote" data-words="1">whore</span>—<br>It does abhor me now I speak the word.<br>To do the act that might the addition earn,<br>Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.
DESDEMONA	4	2	2898	2898	1	4	If ’twere no other—
DESDEMONA	4	3	2982	2982	1	5	Your Honor is most welcome.
DESDEMONA	4	3	2984	2984	1	2	My lord?
DESDEMONA	4	3	2988	2988	1	4	I will, my lord.
DESDEMONA	4	3	2990	2992	3	20	He says he will return incontinent,<br>And hath commanded me to go to bed,<br>And bade me to dismiss you.
DESDEMONA	4	3	2994	2996	3	20	It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,<br>Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.<br>We must not now displease him.
DESDEMONA	4	3	2998	3000	3	27	So would not I. My love doth so approve him<br>That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns—<br>Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor in them.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3002	3004	3	24	All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!<br>If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me<br>In one of those same sheets.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3006	3013	8	73	My mother had a maid called Barbary.<br>She was in love, and he she loved proved mad<br>And did forsake her. She had a song of willow,<br>An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune,<br>And she died singing it. That song tonight<br>Will not go from my mind. I have much to do<br>But to go hang my head all at one side<br>And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3015	3016	2	10	No, unpin me here.<br>This Lodovico is a proper man.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3018	3018	1	3	He speaks well.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3021	3023	15	92	<span class="song" data-words="52">The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,<br>Sing all a green willow.<br>Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,<br>Sing willow, willow, willow.<br>The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her<br>moans,<br>Sing willow, willow, willow;<br>Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the<br>stones—</span>Lay by these.<span class="song" data-words="4">Sing willow, willow, willow.</span><br>Prithee hie thee! He’ll come anon.<span class="song" data-words="17">Sing all a green willow must be my garland.<br>Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.</span><br>Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is ’t that knocks?
DESDEMONA	4	3	3037	3038	6	39	<span class="song" data-words="25">I called my love false love, but what said he then?<br>Sing willow, willow, willow.<br>If I court more women, you’ll couch with more<br>men.—</span>So, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;<br>Doth that bode weeping?
DESDEMONA	4	3	3044	3047	4	31	I have heard it said so. O these men, these men!<br>Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia—<br>That there be women do abuse their husbands<br>In such gross kind?
DESDEMONA	4	3	3050	3050	1	10	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
DESDEMONA	4	3	3052	3052	1	5	No, by this heavenly light!
DESDEMONA	4	3	3055	3055	1	10	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
DESDEMONA	4	3	3058	3058	1	7	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3066	3067	2	13	Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong<br>for the whole world!
DESDEMONA	4	3	3072	3072	1	9	I do not think there is any such woman.
DESDEMONA	4	3	3094	3095	2	19	Good night, good night. God me such uses send,<br>Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3271	3271	1	3	Who’s there? Othello?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3273	3273	1	7	Will you come to bed, my lord?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3275	3275	1	3	Ay, my lord.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3279	3280	2	9	Alack, my lord,<br>What may you mean by that?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3284	3284	1	4	Talk you of killing?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3286	3286	1	6	Then heaven have mercy on me.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3288	3288	1	11	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3290	3293	4	32	And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then<br>When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know<br>not,<br>Since guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3295	3295	1	7	They are loves I bear to you.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3297	3301	5	37	That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.<br>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<br>Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.<br>These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope<br>They do not point on me.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3303	3303	1	6	I will so. What’s the matter?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3307	3308	2	13	No, by my life and soul! Send for the man<br>And ask him.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3311	3311	1	6	Ay, but not yet to die.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3317	3317	1	6	Then Lord have mercy on me!
DESDEMONA	5	2	3319	3322	4	32	And have you mercy, too. I never did<br>Offend you in my life, never loved Cassio<br>But with such general warranty of heaven<br>As I might love. I never gave him token.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3328	3330	3	18	He found it, then.<br>I never gave it him. Send for him hither.<br>Let him confess a truth.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3332	3332	1	3	What, my lord?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3334	3334	1	2	How? Unlawfully?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3336	3336	1	5	He will not say so.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3339	3339	1	8	O, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?
DESDEMONA	5	2	3342	3342	1	9	Alas, he is betrayed, and I undone.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3344	3344	1	9	O banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
DESDEMONA	5	2	3346	3346	1	7	Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3348	3348	1	4	But half an hour!
DESDEMONA	5	2	3350	3350	1	6	But while I say one prayer!
DESDEMONA	5	2	3390	3390	1	4	O falsely, falsely murdered.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3396	3396	1	5	A guiltless death I die.
DESDEMONA	5	2	3398	3399	2	12	Nobody. I myself. Farewell.<br>Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	330	331	2	10	There’s no composition in these news<br>That gives them credit.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	334	334	1	5	And mine, a hundred forty.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	340	343	4	26	Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.<br>I do not so secure me in the error,<br>But the main article I do approve<br>In fearful sense.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	346	346	1	4	Now, what’s the business?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	350	350	1	6	How say you by this change?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	366	366	1	8	Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	379	380	2	12	’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.<br>Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	382	383	2	7	Write from us to him.<br>Post-post-haste. Dispatch.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	385	389	5	30	Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you<br>Against the general enemy Ottoman.<br>I did not see you. Welcome, gentle<br>signior.<br>We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	398	398	1	4	Why, what’s the matter?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	407	412	6	45	Whoe’er he be that in this foul proceeding<br>Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself<br>And you of her, the bloody book of law<br>You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,<br>After your own sense, yea, though our proper son<br>Stood in your action.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	417	417	1	6	We are very sorry for ’t.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	418	418	1	10	What, in your own part, can you say to this?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	454	457	4	27	To vouch this is no proof<br>Without more wider and more overt test<br>Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<br>Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	470	470	1	3	Fetch Desdemona hither.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	477	477	1	3	Say it, Othello.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	526	530	5	30	I think this tale would win my daughter, too.<br>Good Brabantio,<br>Take up this mangled matter at the best.<br>Men do their broken weapons rather use<br>Than their bare hands.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	558	569	12	87	Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,<br>Which as a grise or step may help these lovers<br>Into your favor.<br>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<br>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br>What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,<br>Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.<br>The robbed that smiles steals something from the<br>thief;<br>He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	583	590	8	66	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes<br>for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is<br>best known to you. And though we have there a<br>substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a<br>sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer<br>voice on you. You must therefore be content to<br>slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this<br>more stubborn and boist’rous expedition.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	602	602	1	4	Why, at her father’s.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	611	611	1	4	What would you, Desdemona?
DUKE-OTH	1	3	639	641	3	22	Be it as you shall privately determine,<br>Either for her stay or going. Th’ affair cries haste,<br>And speed must answer it.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	645	649	5	34	At nine i’ th’ morning here we’ll meet again.<br>Othello, leave some officer behind<br>And he shall our commission bring to you,<br>With such things else of quality and respect<br>As doth import you.
DUKE-OTH	1	3	656	660	5	27	Let it be so.<br>Good night to everyone. And, noble<br>signior,<br>If virtue no delighted beauty lack,<br>Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
EMILIA-OTH	2	1	897	897	1	7	You have little cause to say so.
EMILIA-OTH	2	1	905	905	1	6	You shall not write my praise.
EMILIA-OTH	2	1	926	926	1	5	How if fair and foolish?
EMILIA-OTH	3	1	1578	1588	11	85	Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry<br>For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.<br>The General and his wife are talking of it,<br>And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies<br>That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus<br>And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<br>He might not but refuse you. But he protests he<br>loves you<br>And needs no other suitor but his likings<br>To take the safest occasion by the front<br>To bring you in again.
EMILIA-OTH	3	1	1593	1595	3	18	Pray you come in.<br>I will bestow you where you shall have time<br>To speak your bosom freely.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1606	1607	2	15	Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband<br>As if the cause were his.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1634	1634	1	5	Madam, here comes my lord.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1937	1946	10	82	I am glad I have found this napkin.<br>This was her first remembrance from the Moor.<br>My wayward husband hath a hundred times<br>Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token<br>(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)<br>That she reserves it evermore about her<br>To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out<br>And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it<br>Heaven knows, not I.<br>I nothing but to please his fantasy.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1948	1948	1	10	Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1950	1950	1	1	Ha?
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1952	1953	2	14	O, is that all? What will you give me now<br>For that same handkerchief?
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1955	1957	3	19	What handkerchief?<br>Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,<br>That which so often you did bid me steal.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1959	1961	3	21	No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,<br>And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up.<br>Look, here ’tis.
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1963	1965	3	17	What will you do with ’t, that you have been so<br>earnest<br>To have me filch it?
EMILIA-OTH	3	3	1967	1969	3	23	If it be not for some purpose of import,<br>Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad<br>When she shall lack it.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2173	2173	1	4	I know not, madam.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2179	2179	1	4	Is he not jealous?
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2182	2183	2	4	Look where he<br>comes.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2265	2265	1	5	Is not this man jealous?
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2269	2273	5	42	’Tis not a year or two shows us a man.<br>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<br>They eat us hungerly, and when they are full<br>They belch us.<br>Look you—Cassio and my husband.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2301	2302	2	10	He went hence but now,<br>And certainly in strange unquietness.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2325	2327	3	18	Pray heaven it be<br>State matters, as you think, and no conception<br>Nor no jealous toy concerning you.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2329	2332	4	31	But jealous souls will not be answered so.<br>They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br>But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster<br>Begot upon itself, born on itself.
EMILIA-OTH	3	4	2334	2334	1	2	Lady, amen.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2703	2703	1	7	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2705	2706	2	18	But then I saw no harm, and then I heard<br>Each syllable that breath made up between them.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2708	2708	1	3	Never, my lord.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2710	2710	1	1	Never.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2712	2712	1	3	Never, my lord.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2714	2721	8	66	I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,<br>Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,<br>Remove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.<br>If any wretch have put this in your head,<br>Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,<br>For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,<br>There’s no man happy. The purest of their wives<br>Is foul as slander.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2812	2813	2	16	Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?<br>How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2815	2815	1	8	Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2817	2817	1	5	Why, with my lord, madam.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2819	2819	1	6	He that is yours, sweet lady.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2825	2825	1	4	Here’s a change indeed.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2835	2837	3	21	Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,<br>Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her<br>As true hearts cannot bear.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2842	2843	2	18	He called her <span class="quote" data-words="1">whore.</span> A beggar in his drink<br>Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2847	2850	4	25	Hath she forsook so many noble matches,<br>Her father and her country and her friends,<br>To be called <span class="quote" data-words="1">whore</span>? Would it not make one<br>weep?
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2854	2857	4	31	I will be hanged if some eternal villain,<br>Some busy and insinuating rogue,<br>Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,<br>Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2860	2870	11	73	A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!<br>Why should he call her <span class="quote" data-words="1">whore</span>? Who keeps her<br>company?<br>What place? What time? What form? What<br>likelihood?<br>The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,<br>Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.<br>O heaven, that such companions thou ’dst unfold,<br>And put in every honest hand a whip<br>To lash the rascals naked through the world,<br>Even from the east to th’ west!
EMILIA-OTH	4	2	2872	2874	3	26	O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was<br>That turned your wit the seamy side without<br>And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	2989	2989	1	10	How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	2993	2993	1	2	Dismiss me?
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	2997	2997	1	7	I would you had never seen him.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3001	3001	1	11	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3005	3005	1	4	Come, come, you talk!
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3014	3014	1	6	Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3017	3017	1	4	A very handsome man.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3019	3020	2	19	I know a lady in Venice would have walked<br>barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3036	3036	1	3	It’s the wind.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3043	3043	1	5	’Tis neither here nor there.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3048	3049	2	6	There be some such, no<br>question.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3051	3051	1	4	Why, would not you?
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3053	3054	2	16	Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.<br>I might do ’t as well i’ th’ dark.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3056	3057	2	14	The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price<br>for a small vice.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3059	3065	7	67	In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I<br>had done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for<br>a joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for<br>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.<br>But for the whole world—’Uds pity! Who<br>would not make her husband a cuckold to make<br>him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3068	3071	4	31	Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world;<br>and, having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in<br>your own world, and you might quickly make it<br>right.
EMILIA-OTH	4	3	3073	3093	21	176	Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as<br>would store the world they played for.<br>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults<br>If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,<br>And pour our treasures into foreign laps;<br>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br>Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,<br>Or scant our former having in despite.<br>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br>Their wives have sense like them. They see, and<br>smell,<br>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br>As husbands have. What is it that they do<br>When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<br>I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?<br>It is so too. And have not we affections,<br>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br>Then let them use us well. Else let them know,<br>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
EMILIA-OTH	5	1	3226	3227	2	10	Alas, what is the matter? What is the matter,<br>husband?
EMILIA-OTH	5	1	3231	3231	1	6	Alas, good gentleman! Alas, good Cassio!
EMILIA-OTH	5	1	3237	3237	1	5	O fie upon thee, strumpet!
EMILIA-OTH	5	1	3240	3240	1	6	As I? Faugh! Fie upon thee!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3352	3352	1	10	My lord, my lord? What ho! My lord, my lord!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3357	3357	1	6	What, ho! My lord, my lord!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3360	3360	1	11	O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3372	3373	2	14	I do beseech you<br>That I may speak with you. O, good my lord—
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3378	3378	1	8	O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3380	3380	1	4	But now, my lord.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3384	3385	2	10	Cassio, my lord, hath killed<br>A young Venetian called Roderigo.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3387	3387	1	5	No, Cassio is not killed.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3391	3391	1	6	O Lord, what cry is that?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3393	3395	3	22	Out, and alas, that was my lady’s voice!<br>Help! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!<br>Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3397	3397	1	6	O, who hath done this deed?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3401	3402	2	3	Alas, who<br>knows?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3404	3404	1	9	She said so. I must needs report the truth.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3407	3407	1	10	O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3409	3409	1	9	Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3411	3412	2	16	Thou art rash as fire to say<br>That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3417	3417	1	2	My husband?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3419	3419	1	6	That she was false to wedlock?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3424	3424	1	2	My husband?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3428	3428	1	2	My husband?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3431	3432	2	14	O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!—<br>My husband say she was false?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3436	3438	3	28	If he say so, may his pernicious soul<br>Rot half a grain a day! He lies to th’ heart!<br>She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3440	3442	3	17	Do thy worst!<br>This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven<br>Than thou wast worthy her.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3444	3449	6	56	Thou hast not half that power to do me harm<br>As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt,<br>As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed—<br>I care not for thy sword. I’ll make thee known,<br>Though I lost twenty lives. Help! Help, ho! Help!<br>The Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3451	3452	2	18	O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,<br>That men must lay their murders on your neck.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3454	3457	4	35	Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.<br>He says thou told’st him that his wife was false.<br>I know thou didst not. Thou ’rt not such a villain.<br>Speak, for my heart is full.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3460	3460	1	9	But did you ever tell him she was false?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3462	3464	3	25	You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie!<br>Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!<br>She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3466	3467	2	19	I will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak.<br>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3469	3469	1	8	And your reports have set the murder on!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3473	3476	4	26	Villainy, villainy, villainy!<br>I think upon ’t, I think! I smell ’t! O villainy!<br>I thought so then. I’ll kill myself for grief!<br>O villainy! Villainy!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3478	3480	3	23	Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.<br>’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.<br>Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3482	3484	3	19	Nay, lay thee down, and roar!<br>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent<br>That e’er did lift up eye.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3504	3504	1	5	O God! O heavenly God!
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3506	3509	4	33	’Twill out, ’twill out. I peace?<br>No, I will speak as liberal as the north.<br>Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,<br>All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3511	3511	1	3	I will not.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3513	3518	6	39	O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st<br>of<br>I found by fortune, and did give my husband—<br>For often, with a solemn earnestness<br>(More than indeed belonged to such a trifle),<br>He begged of me to steal ’t.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3520	3521	2	16	She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,<br>And I did give ’t my husband.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3523	3526	4	25	By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen!<br>O murd’rous coxcomb, what should<br>such a fool<br>Do with so good a wife?
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3530	3530	1	9	Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress’ side.
EMILIA-OTH	5	2	3541	3546	7	52	What did thy song bode, lady?<br>Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan<br>And die in music.<span class="song" data-words="3">Willow, willow, willow.</span><br>Moor, she was chaste. She loved thee, cruel Moor.<br>So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true.<br>So speaking as I think, alas, I die. 
FIRST_GENTLEMAN	2	1	778	780	3	19	Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.<br>I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main<br>Descry a sail.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	332	333	2	12	Indeed, they are disproportioned.<br>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	351	365	15	107	This cannot be,<br>By no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant<br>To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<br>Th’ importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,<br>And let ourselves again but understand<br>That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br>So may he with more facile question bear it,<br>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br>But altogether lacks th’ abilities<br>That Rhodes is dressed in—if we make thought of<br>this,<br>We must not think the Turk is so unskillful<br>To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br>Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain<br>To wake and wage a danger profitless.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	371	371	1	9	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	381	381	1	4	He’s now in Florence.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	384	384	1	7	Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	400	400	1	1	Dead?
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	417	417	1	6	We are very sorry for ’t.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	458	462	5	31	But, Othello, speak:<br>Did you by indirect and forcèd courses<br>Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?<br>Or came it by request, and such fair question<br>As soul to soul affordeth?
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	642	642	1	4	You must away tonight.
FIRST_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	661	661	1	6	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
GENTLEMEN	2	3	1243	1243	1	2	Excellent well.
GENTLEMEN	3	2	1603	1603	1	5	We wait upon your Lordship.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3138	3138	1	8	’Tis some mischance. The voice is very direful.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3147	3148	2	10	Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and<br>weapons.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3155	3155	1	8	This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3178	3178	1	1	Cassio?
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3190	3190	1	13	I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3201	3201	1	3	What, of Venice?
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3203	3203	1	3	Know him? Ay.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3207	3207	1	6	I am glad to see you.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	1	3209	3209	1	1	Roderigo?
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3453	3453	1	4	What is the matter?
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3471	3471	1	4	’Tis a strange truth.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3490	3495	6	48	Poor Desdemon, I am glad thy father’s dead.<br>Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief<br>Shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,<br>This sight would make him do a desperate turn,<br>Yea, curse his better angel from his side,<br>And fall to reprobance.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3512	3512	1	6	Fie, your sword upon a woman!
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3529	3529	1	9	The woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3531	3531	1	6	He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3551	3552	2	17	If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;<br>Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3555	3555	1	4	What is the matter?
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3604	3604	1	5	Torments will ope your lips.
GRATIANO-OTH	5	2	3665	3665	1	6	All that is spoke is marred.
HERALD-OTH	2	2	1111	1122	12	101	It is Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant<br>general, that upon certain tidings now arrived,<br>importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,<br>every man put himself into triumph: some to<br>dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what<br>sport and revels his addition leads him. For besides<br>these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his<br>nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed<br>All offices are open, and there is full<br>liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till<br>the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of<br>Cyprus and our noble general, Othello!
IAGO	1	1	122	127	6	55	Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not<br>serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to<br>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll<br>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,<br>you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have<br>coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.
IAGO	1	1	129	131	3	22	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter<br>and the Moor are now making the beast with<br>two backs.
IAGO	1	1	133	133	1	4	You are a senator.
IAGO	1	1	161	177	17	134	Farewell, for I must leave you.<br>It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place<br>To be producted, as if I stay I shall,<br>Against the Moor. For I do know the state,<br>However this may gall him with some check,<br>Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked<br>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br>Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,<br>Another of his fathom they have none<br>To lead their business. In which regard,<br>Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,<br>Yet, for necessity of present life,<br>I must show out a flag and sign of love—<br>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find<br>him,<br>Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search,<br>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
IAGO	1	1	37	42	6	45	Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service.<br>Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br>And not by old gradation, where each second<br>Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself<br>Whether I in any just term am affined<br>To love the Moor.
IAGO	1	1	4	6	3	17	’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!<br>If ever I did dream of such a matter,<br>Abhor me.
IAGO	1	1	44	71	28	204	O, sir, content you.<br>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.<br>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark<br>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave<br>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,<br>For naught but provender, and when he’s old,<br>cashiered.<br>Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are<br>Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,<br>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined<br>their coats,<br>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some<br>soul,<br>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.<br>In following him, I follow but myself.<br>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>But seeming so for my peculiar end.<br>For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>The native act and figure of my heart<br>In complement extern, ’tis not long after<br>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.
IAGO	1	1	74	80	7	52	Call up her father.<br>Rouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,<br>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,<br>Yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t<br>As it may lose some color.
IAGO	1	1	8	35	28	194	Despise me<br>If I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>Off-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,<br>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.<br>But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>Evades them with a bombast circumstance,<br>Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,<br>And in conclusion,<br>Nonsuits my mediators. For <span class="quote" data-words="1">Certes,</span> says he,<br><span class="quote" data-words="6">I have already chose my officer.</span><br>And what was he?<br>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br>A fellow almost damned in a fair wife,<br>That never set a squadron in the field,<br>Nor the division of a battle knows<br>More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,<br>Wherein the togèd consuls can propose<br>As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice<br>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;<br>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds<br>Christened and heathen, must be beleed and<br>calmed<br>By debitor and creditor. This countercaster,<br>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.
IAGO	1	1	82	84	3	21	Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br>As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br>Is spied in populous cities.
IAGO	1	1	86	88	3	17	Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!<br>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!<br>Thieves, thieves!
IAGO	1	1	92	92	1	4	Are your doors locked?
IAGO	1	1	94	101	8	56	Zounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your<br>gown!<br>Your heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.<br>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!<br>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.<br>Arise, I say!
IAGO	1	2	207	212	6	48	Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br>Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience<br>To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity<br>Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times<br>I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the<br>ribs.
IAGO	1	2	214	225	12	85	Nay, but he prated<br>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<br>Against your Honor,<br>That with the little godliness I have<br>I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,<br>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<br>That the magnifico is much beloved,<br>And hath in his effect a voice potential<br>As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you<br>Or put upon you what restraint or grievance<br>The law (with all his might to enforce it on)<br>Will give him cable.
IAGO	1	2	239	240	2	13	Those are the raisèd father and his friends.<br>You were best go in.
IAGO	1	2	244	244	1	5	By Janus, I think no.
IAGO	1	2	266	267	2	16	Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.<br>If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.
IAGO	1	2	269	269	1	2	He’s married.
IAGO	1	2	271	272	2	9	Marry, to—<br>Come, captain, will you go?
IAGO	1	2	275	276	2	11	It is Brabantio. General, be advised,<br>He comes to bad intent.
IAGO	1	2	281	281	1	8	You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
IAGO	1	3	673	673	1	5	What sayst thou, noble heart?
IAGO	1	3	675	675	1	6	Why, go to bed and sleep.
IAGO	1	3	677	678	2	13	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,<br>thou silly gentleman!
IAGO	1	3	682	687	6	57	O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for<br>four times seven years, and since I could distinguish<br>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found<br>man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say<br>I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I<br>would change my humanity with a baboon.
IAGO	1	3	690	704	15	135	Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or<br>thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our<br>wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles<br>or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,<br>supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it<br>with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or<br>manured with industry, why the power and corrigible<br>authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance<br>of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise<br>another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our<br>natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous<br>conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging<br>motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts—<br>whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or<br>scion.
IAGO	1	3	706	733	28	260	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission<br>of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown<br>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy<br>friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving<br>with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never<br>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.<br>Follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an<br>usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It<br>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue<br>her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—<br>nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in<br>her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration<br>—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are<br>changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.<br>The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts<br>shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.<br>She must change for youth. When she is sated<br>with his body she will find the error of her choice.<br>Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt<br>needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than<br>drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony<br>and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian<br>and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my<br>wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.<br>Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!<br>It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be<br>hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned<br>and go without her.
IAGO	1	3	736	744	9	81	Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have<br>told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I<br>hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no<br>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge<br>against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost<br>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many<br>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.<br>Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more<br>of this tomorrow. Adieu.
IAGO	1	3	746	746	1	3	At my lodging.
IAGO	1	3	748	748	1	7	Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
IAGO	1	3	750	750	1	7	No more of drowning, do you hear?
IAGO	1	3	752	753	2	9	Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your<br>purse.
IAGO	1	3	755	776	22	187	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.<br>For I mine own gained knowledge should profane<br>If I would time expend with such a snipe<br>But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,<br>And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets<br>’Has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,<br>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.<br>The better shall my purpose work on him.<br>Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now:<br>To get his place and to plume up my will<br>In double knavery—How? how?—Let’s see.<br>After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear<br>That he is too familiar with his wife.<br>He hath a person and a smooth dispose<br>To be suspected, framed to make women false.<br>The Moor is of a free and open nature<br>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br>And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose<br>As asses are.<br>I have ’t. It is engendered. Hell and night<br>Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.
IAGO	2	1	1010	1016	7	61	Do thou meet me presently<br>at the harbor. Come hither. If<br>thou be’st valiant—as they say base men being in<br>love have then a nobility in their natures more than<br>is native to them—list me. The Lieutenant tonight<br>watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee<br>this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
IAGO	2	1	1018	1046	29	257	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.<br>Mark me with what violence she first loved the<br>Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical<br>lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not<br>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And<br>what delight shall she have to look on the devil?<br>When the blood is made dull with the act of sport,<br>there should be, again to inflame it and to give<br>satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy<br>in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor<br>is defective in. Now, for want of these required<br>conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself<br>abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and<br>abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it<br>and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,<br>this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced<br>position—who stands so eminent in the degree of<br>this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no<br>further conscionable than in putting on the mere<br>form of civil and humane seeming for the better<br>compassing of his salt and most hidden loose<br>affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and<br>subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an<br>eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though<br>true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!<br>Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all<br>those requisites in him that folly and green minds<br>look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the<br>woman hath found him already.
IAGO	2	1	1049	1053	5	41	Blessed fig’s end! The wine she drinks is made of<br>grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never<br>have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou<br>not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst<br>not mark that?
IAGO	2	1	1055	1068	14	117	Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure<br>prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.<br>They met so near with their lips that their breaths<br>embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!<br>When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard<br>at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’<br>incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled<br>by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you<br>tonight. For the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.<br>Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do<br>you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by<br>speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from<br>what other course you please, which the time shall<br>more favorably minister.
IAGO	2	1	1070	1078	9	83	Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and<br>haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,<br>for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to<br>mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no<br>true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So<br>shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by<br>the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the<br>impediment most profitably removed, without the<br>which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
IAGO	2	1	1081	1082	2	18	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I<br>must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
IAGO	2	1	1084	1110	27	220	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.<br>That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.<br>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<br>And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona<br>A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,<br>Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure<br>I stand accountant for as great a sin)<br>But partly led to diet my revenge<br>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof<br>Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,<br>And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,<br>Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>At least into a jealousy so strong<br>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace<br>For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br>I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb<br>(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),<br>Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me<br>For making him egregiously an ass<br>And practicing upon his peace and quiet<br>Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confused.<br>Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.
IAGO	2	1	888	890	3	23	Sir, would she give you so much of her lips<br>As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,<br>You would have enough.
IAGO	2	1	892	896	5	33	In faith, too much.<br>I find it still when I have list to sleep.<br>Marry, before your Ladyship, I grant,<br>She puts her tongue a little in her heart<br>And chides with thinking.
IAGO	2	1	898	901	4	34	Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,<br>bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,<br>saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players<br>in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds.
IAGO	2	1	903	904	2	20	Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.<br>You rise to play, and go to bed to work.
IAGO	2	1	906	906	1	4	No, let me not.
IAGO	2	1	909	910	2	16	O, gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,<br>For I am nothing if not critical.
IAGO	2	1	912	912	1	2	Ay, madam.
IAGO	2	1	916	919	6	49	I am about it, but indeed my invention comes<br>from my pate as birdlime does from frieze: it<br>plucks out brains and all.

Very good; well<br>kissed; an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet<br>again your fingers to your lips? Would they were<br>clyster pipes for your sake!<br>The Moor. I know his trumpet.
IAGO	2	1	994	996	3	21	O, you are well tuned now,<br>But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,<br>As honest as I am.
IAGO	2	3	1137	1141	5	45	Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’<br>clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of<br>his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame;<br>he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and<br>she is sport for Jove.
IAGO	2	3	1143	1143	1	7	And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.
IAGO	2	3	1146	1147	2	12	What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley<br>to provocation.
IAGO	2	3	1150	1150	1	11	And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
IAGO	2	3	1152	1155	4	34	Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,<br>I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a<br>brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a<br>measure to the health of black Othello.
IAGO	2	3	1160	1161	2	12	O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink<br>for you.
IAGO	2	3	1166	1167	2	11	What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants<br>desire it.
IAGO	2	3	1169	1169	1	10	Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.
IAGO	2	3	1171	1188	18	128	If I can fasten but one cup upon him<br>With that which he hath drunk tonight already,<br>He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense<br>As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool<br>Roderigo,<br>Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,<br>To Desdemona hath tonight caroused<br>Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch.<br>Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits<br>That hold their honors in a wary distance,<br>The very elements of this warlike isle,<br>Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;<br>And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of<br>drunkards<br>Am I to put our Cassio in some action<br>That may offend the isle. But here they come.<br>If consequence do but approve my dream,<br>My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.
IAGO	2	3	1193	1194	7	36	Some wine, ho!<span class="song" data-words="29">And let me the cannikin clink, clink,<br>And let me the cannikin clink.<br>A soldier’s a man,<br>O, man’s life’s but a span,<br>Why, then, let a soldier drink.</span><br>Some wine, boys!
IAGO	2	3	1201	1204	4	28	I learned it in England, where indeed they are<br>most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,<br>and your swag-bellied Hollander—drink, ho!—are<br>nothing to your English.
IAGO	2	3	1207	1210	4	30	Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane<br>dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.<br>He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next<br>pottle can be filled.
IAGO	2	3	1214	1215	10	62	O sweet England!<span class="song" data-words="55">King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,<br>His breeches cost him but a crown;<br>He held them sixpence all too dear;<br>With that he called the tailor lown.<br>He was a wight of high renown,<br>And thou art but of low degree;<br>’Tis pride that pulls the country down,<br>Then take thy auld cloak about thee.</span><br>Some wine, ho!
IAGO	2	3	1226	1226	1	5	Will you hear ’t again?
IAGO	2	3	1231	1231	1	4	It’s true, good lieutenant.
IAGO	2	3	1234	1234	1	6	And so do I too, lieutenant.
IAGO	2	3	1247	1254	8	62	You see this fellow that is gone before?<br>He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<br>And give direction; and do but see his vice.<br>’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<br>The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.<br>I fear the trust Othello puts him in,<br>On some odd time of his infirmity,<br>Will shake this island.
IAGO	2	3	1256	1258	3	20	’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.<br>He’ll watch the horologe a double set<br>If drink rock not his cradle.
IAGO	2	3	1264	1265	2	10	How now, Roderigo?<br>I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.
IAGO	2	3	1271	1274	4	28	Not I, for this fair island.<br>I do love Cassio well and would do much<br>To cure him of this evil—<br>But hark! What noise?
IAGO	2	3	1287	1293	7	55	Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.<br>Nay, good lieutenant.—God’s will, gentlemen!—<br>Help, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—sir—<br>Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!<br>Who’s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!<br>The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold!<br>You will be shamed forever.
IAGO	2	3	1299	1302	4	24	Hold, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—<br>gentlemen—<br>Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<br>Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!
IAGO	2	3	1313	1321	9	72	I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,<br>In quarter and in terms like bride and groom<br>Divesting them for bed; and then but now,<br>As if some planet had unwitted men,<br>Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,<br>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<br>Any beginning to this peevish odds,<br>And would in action glorious I had lost<br>Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
IAGO	2	3	1357	1383	27	213	Touch me not so near.<br>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br>Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.<br>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:<br>Montano and myself being in speech,<br>There comes a fellow crying out for help,<br>And Cassio following him with determined sword<br>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.<br>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br>Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out—<br>The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,<br>Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather<br>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords<br>And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight<br>I ne’er might say before. When I came back—<br>For this was brief—I found them close together<br>At blow and thrust, even as again they were<br>When you yourself did part them.<br>More of this matter cannot I report.<br>But men are men; the best sometimes forget.<br>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br>From him that fled some strange indignity<br>Which patience could not pass.
IAGO	2	3	1400	1400	1	5	What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
IAGO	2	3	1402	1402	1	3	Marry, God forbid!
IAGO	2	3	1407	1417	11	100	As I am an honest man, I thought you had<br>received some bodily wound. There is more sense<br>in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and<br>most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost<br>without deserving. You have lost no reputation at<br>all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,<br>man, there are ways to recover the General again!<br>You are but now cast in his mood—a punishment<br>more in policy than in malice, even so as one would<br>beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious<br>lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.
IAGO	2	3	1425	1426	2	15	What was he that you followed with your sword?<br>What had he done to you?
IAGO	2	3	1428	1428	1	3	Is ’t possible?
IAGO	2	3	1435	1436	2	12	Why, but you are now well enough. How came<br>you thus recovered?
IAGO	2	3	1440	1443	4	41	Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,<br>the place, and the condition of this country stands,<br>I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But<br>since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
IAGO	2	3	1450	1452	3	29	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,<br>if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.<br>And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
IAGO	2	3	1454	1467	14	129	You or any man living may be drunk at a time,<br>man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s<br>wife is now the general: I may say so in this<br>respect, for that he hath devoted and given up<br>himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement<br>of her parts and graces. Confess yourself<br>freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your<br>place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so<br>blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her<br>goodness not to do more than she is requested. This<br>broken joint between you and her husband entreat<br>her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay<br>worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow<br>stronger than it was before.
IAGO	2	3	1469	1470	2	10	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest<br>kindness.
IAGO	2	3	1475	1476	2	13	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I<br>must to the watch.
IAGO	2	3	1478	1505	28	222	And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain,<br>When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>Probal to thinking, and indeed the course<br>To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy<br>Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful<br>As the free elements. And then for her<br>To win the Moor—were ’t to renounce his baptism,<br>All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin—<br>His soul is so enfettered to her love<br>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course<br>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>As I do now. For whiles this honest fool<br>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,<br>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear:<br>That she repeals him for her body’s lust;<br>And by how much she strives to do him good,<br>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>And out of her own goodness make the net<br>That shall enmesh them all.<br>How now, Roderigo?
IAGO	2	3	1513	1532	20	153	How poor are they that have not patience!<br>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<br>Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,<br>And wit depends on dilatory time.<br>Dost not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,<br>And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.<br>Though other things grow fair against the sun,<br>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.<br>Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning!<br>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.<br>Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.<br>Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.<br>Nay, get thee gone.<br>Two things are to be done.<br>My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.<br>I’ll set her on.<br>Myself the while to draw the Moor apart<br>And bring him jump when he may Cassio find<br>Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.<br>Dull not device by coldness and delay.
IAGO	3	1	1565	1565	1	6	You have not been abed, then?
IAGO	3	1	1571	1574	4	28	I’ll send her to you presently,<br>And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor<br>Out of the way, that your converse and business<br>May be more free.
IAGO	3	2	1601	1601	1	7	Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.
IAGO	3	3	1640	1640	1	5	Ha, I like not that.
IAGO	3	3	1642	1642	1	9	Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.
IAGO	3	3	1644	1646	3	19	Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it<br>That he would steal away so guiltylike,<br>Seeing your coming.
IAGO	3	3	1706	1706	1	3	My noble lord—
IAGO	3	3	1708	1709	2	12	Did Michael Cassio,<br>When you wooed my lady, know of your love?
IAGO	3	3	1711	1712	2	10	But for a satisfaction of my thought,<br>No further harm.
IAGO	3	3	1714	1714	1	10	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
IAGO	3	3	1716	1716	1	1	Indeed?
IAGO	3	3	1719	1719	1	3	Honest, my lord?
IAGO	3	3	1721	1721	1	6	My lord, for aught I know.
IAGO	3	3	1723	1723	1	3	Think, my lord?
IAGO	3	3	1737	1737	1	7	My lord, you know I love you.
IAGO	3	3	1747	1748	2	13	For Michael Cassio,<br>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
IAGO	3	3	1750	1751	2	16	Men should be what they seem;<br>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
IAGO	3	3	1753	1753	1	8	Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
IAGO	3	3	1759	1769	11	67	Good my lord, pardon me.<br>Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and<br>false—<br>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things<br>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so<br>pure<br>But some uncleanly apprehensions<br>Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit<br>With meditations lawful?
IAGO	3	3	1773	1783	11	80	I do beseech you,<br>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—<br>As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague<br>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<br>Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom<br>From one that so imperfectly conceits<br>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<br>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br>It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br>Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,<br>To let you know my thoughts.
IAGO	3	3	1785	1793	9	57	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.<br>Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,<br>nothing;<br>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to<br>thousands.<br>But he that filches from me my good name<br>Robs me of that which not enriches him<br>And makes me poor indeed.
IAGO	3	3	1795	1796	2	17	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,<br>Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.
IAGO	3	3	1798	1803	6	49	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!<br>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss<br>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br>But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er<br>Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!
IAGO	3	3	1805	1809	5	36	Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;<br>But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br>Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend<br>From jealousy!
IAGO	3	3	1827	1839	13	107	I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason<br>To show the love and duty that I bear you<br>With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,<br>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br>Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.<br>I would not have your free and noble nature,<br>Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.<br>I know our country disposition well.<br>In Venice they do let God see the pranks<br>They dare not show their husbands. Their best<br>conscience<br>Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.
IAGO	3	3	1841	1843	3	21	She did deceive her father, marrying you,<br>And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,<br>She loved them most.
IAGO	3	3	1845	1851	7	46	Why, go to, then!<br>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<br>To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,<br>He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to<br>blame.<br>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br>For too much loving you.
IAGO	3	3	1853	1853	1	9	I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
IAGO	3	3	1855	1860	6	44	I’ faith, I fear it has.<br>I hope you will consider what is spoke<br>Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.<br>I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br>To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br>Than to suspicion.
IAGO	3	3	1862	1866	5	30	Should you do so, my lord,<br>My speech should fall into such vile success<br>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy<br>friend.<br>My lord, I see you’re moved.
IAGO	3	3	1869	1869	1	11	Long live she so! And long live you to think so!
IAGO	3	3	1871	1881	11	80	Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,<br>Not to affect many proposèd matches<br>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br>Whereto we see in all things nature tends—<br>Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,<br>Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—<br>But pardon me—I do not in position<br>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear<br>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<br>May fall to match you with her country forms<br>And happily repent.
IAGO	3	3	1885	1885	1	6	My lord, I take my leave.
IAGO	3	3	1888	1899	12	103	My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor<br>To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.<br>Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—<br>For sure he fills it up with great ability—<br>Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<br>You shall by that perceive him and his means.<br>Note if your lady strain his entertainment<br>With any strong or vehement importunity.<br>Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,<br>Let me be thought too busy in my fears—<br>As worthy cause I have to fear I am—<br>And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.
IAGO	3	3	1901	1901	1	6	I once more take my leave.
IAGO	3	3	1947	1947	1	7	How now? What do you here alone?
IAGO	3	3	1949	1949	1	11	You have a thing for me? It is a common thing—
IAGO	3	3	1951	1951	1	5	To have a foolish wife.
IAGO	3	3	1954	1954	1	2	What handkerchief?
IAGO	3	3	1958	1958	1	5	Hast stol’n it from her?
IAGO	3	3	1962	1962	1	6	A good wench! Give it me.
IAGO	3	3	1966	1966	1	6	Why, what is that to you?
IAGO	3	3	1970	1985	16	118	Be not acknown on ’t.<br>I have use for it. Go, leave me.<br>I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin<br>And let him find it. Trifles light as air<br>Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br>As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.<br>The Moor already changes with my poison;<br>Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,<br>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<br>But with a little act upon the blood<br>Burn like the mines of sulfur.<br>I did say so.<br>Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora<br>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world<br>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br>Which thou owedst yesterday.
IAGO	3	3	1987	1987	1	8	Why, how now, general? No more of that!
IAGO	3	3	1991	1991	1	4	How now, my lord?
IAGO	3	3	1999	1999	1	6	I am sorry to hear this.
IAGO	3	3	2013	2013	1	5	Is ’t possible, my lord?
IAGO	3	3	2019	2019	1	5	Is ’t come to this?
IAGO	3	3	2023	2023	1	3	My noble lord—
IAGO	3	3	2030	2037	8	69	O grace! O heaven forgive me!<br>Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?<br>God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,<br>That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!—<br>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:<br>To be direct and honest is not safe.—<br>I thank you for this profit, and from hence<br>I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.
IAGO	3	3	2039	2040	2	14	I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool<br>And loses that it works for.
IAGO	3	3	2049	2051	3	22	I see you are eaten up with passion.<br>I do repent me that I put it to you.<br>You would be satisfied?
IAGO	3	3	2053	2055	3	18	And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?<br>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,<br>Behold her topped?
IAGO	3	3	2057	2068	12	94	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br>To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then<br>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br>More than their own! What then? How then?<br>What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?<br>It is impossible you should see this,<br>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br>As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,<br>If imputation and strong circumstances<br>Which lead directly to the door of truth<br>Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.
IAGO	3	3	2070	2084	16	139	I do not like the office,<br>But sith I am entered in this cause so far,<br>Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,<br>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,<br>And being troubled with a raging tooth<br>I could not sleep. There are a kind of men<br>So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter<br>Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.<br>In sleep I heard him say <span class="quote" data-words="11">Sweet Desdemona,Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.</span><br>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br>Cry <span class="quote" data-words="3">O sweet creature!</span> then kiss me hard,<br>As if he plucked up kisses by the roots<br>That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg<br>O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then<br>Cried <span class="quote" data-words="8">Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!</span>
IAGO	3	3	2087	2088	2	6	Nay, this was but his<br>dream.
IAGO	3	3	2091	2092	2	12	And this may help to thicken other proofs<br>That do demonstrate thinly.
IAGO	3	3	2094	2097	4	32	Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.<br>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:<br>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?
IAGO	3	3	2099	2101	3	24	I know not that; but such a handkerchief—<br>I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today<br>See Cassio wipe his beard with.
IAGO	3	3	2103	2104	2	17	If it be that, or any that was hers,<br>It speaks against her with the other proofs.
IAGO	3	3	2114	2114	1	3	Yet be content.
IAGO	3	3	2116	2116	1	8	Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.
IAGO	3	3	2128	2135	8	51	Do not rise yet.<br>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br>You elements that clip us round about,<br>Witness that here Iago doth give up<br>The execution of his wit, hands, heart<br>To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,<br>And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br>What bloody business ever.
IAGO	3	3	2142	2143	2	13	My friend is dead.<br>’Tis done at your request. But let her live.
IAGO	3	3	2149	2149	1	5	I am your own forever.
IAGO	3	4	2274	2275	2	18	There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,<br>And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
IAGO	3	4	2300	2300	1	4	Is my lord angry?
IAGO	3	4	2303	2308	6	52	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon<br>When it hath blown his ranks into the air<br>And, like the devil, from his very arm<br>Puffed his own brother—and is he angry?<br>Something of moment then. I will go meet him.<br>There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry.
IAGO	4	1	2381	2381	1	4	Will you think so?
IAGO	4	1	2383	2383	1	5	What, to kiss in private?
IAGO	4	1	2385	2386	2	17	Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br>An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
IAGO	4	1	2392	2393	2	16	If they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.<br>But if I give my wife a handkerchief—
IAGO	4	1	2395	2396	2	18	Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,<br>She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.
IAGO	4	1	2399	2401	3	21	Her honor is an essence that’s not seen;<br>They have it very oft that have it not.<br>But for the handkerchief—
IAGO	4	1	2406	2406	1	4	Ay, what of that?
IAGO	4	1	2408	2413	6	44	What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br>Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,<br>Who having, by their own importunate suit<br>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br>Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose<br>But they must blab)—
IAGO	4	1	2415	2416	2	14	He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,<br>No more than he’ll unswear.
IAGO	4	1	2418	2418	1	10	Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
IAGO	4	1	2420	2420	1	1	Lie—
IAGO	4	1	2422	2422	1	7	With her—on her—what you will.
IAGO	4	1	2433	2439	7	36	Work on,<br>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are<br>caught,<br>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<br>All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!<br>My lord, I say. Othello!<br>How now, Cassio?
IAGO	4	1	2441	2442	2	16	My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.<br>This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.
IAGO	4	1	2444	2451	8	62	No, forbear.<br>The lethargy must have his quiet course.<br>If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by<br>Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.<br>Do you withdraw yourself a little while.<br>He will recover straight. When he is gone,<br>I would on great occasion speak with you.<br>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?
IAGO	4	1	2453	2454	2	15	I mock you not, by heaven!<br>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
IAGO	4	1	2456	2457	2	14	There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,<br>And many a civil monster.
IAGO	4	1	2459	2467	9	73	Good sir, be a man!<br>Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked<br>May draw with you. There’s millions now alive<br>That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br>Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.<br>O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,<br>To lip a wanton in a secure couch<br>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,<br>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
IAGO	4	1	2469	2484	16	124	Stand you awhile apart.<br>Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br>Whilst you were here, o’erwhelmèd with your grief—<br>A passion most unsuiting such a man—<br>Cassio came hither. I shifted him away<br>And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,<br>Bade him anon return and here speak with me,<br>The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<br>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns<br>That dwell in every region of his face.<br>For I will make him tell the tale anew—<br>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br>He hath and is again to cope your wife.<br>I say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,<br>Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen,<br>And nothing of a man.
IAGO	4	1	2488	2500	13	101	That’s not amiss.<br>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?<br>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br>A huswife that by selling her desires<br>Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature<br>That dotes on Cassio—as ’tis the strumpet’s plague<br>To beguile many and be beguiled by one.<br>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain<br>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.<br>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,<br>And his unbookish jealousy must construe<br>Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors<br>Quite in the wrong.—How do you, lieutenant?
IAGO	4	1	2503	2505	3	22	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.<br>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,<br>How quickly should you speed!
IAGO	4	1	2508	2508	1	7	I never knew woman love man so.
IAGO	4	1	2511	2511	1	4	Do you hear, Cassio?
IAGO	4	1	2514	2515	2	13	She gives it out that you shall marry her.<br>Do you intend it?
IAGO	4	1	2522	2522	1	8	Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.
IAGO	4	1	2524	2524	1	6	I am a very villain else.
IAGO	4	1	2543	2543	1	6	Before me, look where she comes.
IAGO	4	1	2560	2560	1	4	After her, after her!
IAGO	4	1	2562	2562	1	4	Will you sup there?
IAGO	4	1	2564	2565	2	15	Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very<br>fain speak with you.
IAGO	4	1	2567	2567	1	5	Go to; say no more.
IAGO	4	1	2570	2570	1	9	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
IAGO	4	1	2572	2572	1	6	And did you see the handkerchief?
IAGO	4	1	2574	2576	3	26	Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes<br>the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and<br>he hath giv’n it his whore.
IAGO	4	1	2579	2579	1	5	Nay, you must forget that.
IAGO	4	1	2585	2585	1	5	Nay, that’s not your way.
IAGO	4	1	2590	2590	1	6	She’s the worse for all this.
IAGO	4	1	2593	2593	1	3	Ay, too gentle.
IAGO	4	1	2596	2598	3	23	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her<br>patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes<br>near nobody.
IAGO	4	1	2600	2600	1	5	O, ’tis foul in her.
IAGO	4	1	2602	2602	1	2	That’s fouler.
IAGO	4	1	2606	2607	2	16	Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,<br>even the bed she hath contaminated.
IAGO	4	1	2610	2611	2	14	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You<br>shall hear more by midnight.
IAGO	4	1	2614	2616	3	22	I warrant something from Venice.<br>’Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.<br>See, your wife’s with him.
IAGO	4	1	2622	2623	2	11	I am very glad to see you, signior.<br>Welcome to Cyprus.
IAGO	4	1	2625	2625	1	2	Lives, sir.
IAGO	4	1	2682	2683	2	4	He is much<br>changed.
IAGO	4	1	2685	2687	3	27	He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure<br>What he might be. If what he might he is not,<br>I would to heaven he were.
IAGO	4	1	2689	2690	2	16	’Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew<br>That stroke would prove the worst.
IAGO	4	1	2694	2700	7	43	Alas, alas!<br>It is not honesty in me to speak<br>What I have seen and known. You shall observe<br>him,<br>And his own courses will denote him so<br>That I may save my speech. Do but go after<br>And mark how he continues.
IAGO	4	2	2829	2829	1	10	What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with you?
IAGO	4	2	2834	2834	1	5	What is the matter, lady?
IAGO	4	2	2839	2840	2	4	What name, fair<br>lady?
IAGO	4	2	2844	2844	1	4	Why did he so?
IAGO	4	2	2846	2846	1	9	Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!
IAGO	4	2	2852	2852	1	10	Beshrew him for ’t! How comes this trick upon him?
IAGO	4	2	2858	2858	1	9	Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.
IAGO	4	2	2871	2871	1	3	Speak within door.
IAGO	4	2	2875	2875	1	6	You are a fool. Go to!
IAGO	4	2	2895	2897	3	23	I pray you be content. ’Tis but his humor.<br>The business of the state does him offense,<br>And he does chide with you.
IAGO	4	2	2899	2903	5	41	It is but so, I warrant.<br>Hark how these instruments summon to supper.<br>The messengers of Venice stays the meat.<br>Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.<br>How now, Roderigo?
IAGO	4	2	2906	2906	1	4	What in the contrary?
IAGO	4	2	2913	2913	1	5	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
IAGO	4	2	2916	2916	1	5	You charge me most unjustly.
IAGO	4	2	2924	2924	1	5	Well, go to! Very well.
IAGO	4	2	2928	2928	1	2	Very well.
IAGO	4	2	2934	2934	1	4	You have said now.
IAGO	4	2	2937	2942	6	49	Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even<br>from this instant do build on thee a better opinion<br>than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.<br>Thou hast taken against me a most just exception,<br>but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy<br>affair.
IAGO	4	2	2944	2951	8	67	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your<br>suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,<br>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I<br>have greater reason to believe now than ever—I<br>mean purpose, courage, and valor—this night show<br>it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,<br>take me from this world with treachery and<br>devise engines for my life.
IAGO	4	2	2954	2955	2	14	Sir, there is especial commission come from<br>Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.
IAGO	4	2	2958	2961	4	34	O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away<br>with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be<br>lingered here by some accident—wherein none<br>can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
IAGO	4	2	2963	2964	2	12	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s<br>place: knocking out his brains.
IAGO	4	2	2966	2976	11	117	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He<br>sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to<br>him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If<br>you will watch his going thence (which I will<br>fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may<br>take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second<br>your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,<br>stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will<br>show you such a necessity in his death that you shall<br>think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high<br>supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!
IAGO	4	2	2978	2978	1	5	And you shall be satisfied.
IAGO	5	1	3096	3101	6	43	Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he<br>come.<br>Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.<br>Quick, quick! Fear nothing. I’ll be at thy elbow.<br>It makes us or it mars us—think on that,<br>And fix most firm thy resolution.
IAGO	5	1	3103	3103	1	10	Here, at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand.
IAGO	5	1	3107	3118	12	101	I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,<br>And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,<br>Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,<br>Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,<br>He calls me to a restitution large<br>Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him<br>As gifts to Desdemona.<br>It must not be. If Cassio do remain,<br>He hath a daily beauty in his life<br>That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor<br>May unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril.<br>No, he must die. Be ’t so. I hear him coming.
IAGO	5	1	3149	3150	2	10	Who’s there? Whose noise is this that cries on<br>murder?
IAGO	5	1	3152	3152	1	6	Did not you hear a cry?
IAGO	5	1	3154	3154	1	3	What’s the matter?
IAGO	5	1	3157	3157	1	8	What are you here that cry so grievously?
IAGO	5	1	3160	3160	1	8	O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
IAGO	5	1	3163	3165	3	17	O treacherous villains!<br>What are you there?<br>Come in, and give some help.
IAGO	5	1	3168	3168	1	5	O murd’rous slave! O villain!
IAGO	5	1	3170	3173	4	28	Kill men i’ th’ dark?—Where be these bloody<br>thieves?<br>How silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!—<br>What may you be? Are you of good or evil?
IAGO	5	1	3175	3175	1	2	Signior Lodovico?
IAGO	5	1	3177	3177	1	9	I cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.
IAGO	5	1	3179	3179	1	4	How is ’t, brother?
IAGO	5	1	3181	3182	2	11	Marry, heaven forbid!<br>Light, gentlemen. I’ll bind it with my shirt.
IAGO	5	1	3184	3184	1	5	Who is ’t that cried?
IAGO	5	1	3187	3188	2	16	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect<br>Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
IAGO	5	1	3191	3192	2	14	Lend me a garter. So.—O for a chair<br>To bear him easily hence!
IAGO	5	1	3194	3200	7	47	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash<br>To be a party in this injury.—<br>Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come;<br>Lend me a light. Know we this<br>face or no?<br>Alas, my friend and my dear countryman<br>Roderigo? No! Yes, sure. O heaven, Roderigo!
IAGO	5	1	3202	3202	1	7	Even he, sir. Did you know him?
IAGO	5	1	3204	3206	3	18	Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon.<br>These bloody accidents must excuse my manners<br>That so neglected you.
IAGO	5	1	3208	3208	1	9	How do you, Cassio?—O, a chair, a chair!
IAGO	5	1	3210	3216	7	50	He, he, ’tis he! O, that’s well<br>said; the chair.—<br>Some good man bear him carefully from hence.<br>I’ll fetch the General’s surgeon.— For you, mistress,<br>Save you your labor.—He that lies slain here,<br>Cassio,<br>Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?
IAGO	5	1	3218	3225	8	72	What, look you pale?—O, bear him out o’ th’ air.<br>Stay you, good<br>gentlemen.—Look you pale, mistress?—<br>Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?—<br>Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.—<br>Behold her well. I pray you, look upon her.<br>Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak<br>Though tongues were out of use.
IAGO	5	1	3228	3230	3	22	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<br>By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped.<br>He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
IAGO	5	1	3232	3234	3	24	This is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,<br>Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight.<br>What, do you shake at that?
IAGO	5	1	3236	3236	1	10	O, did he so? I charge you go with me.
IAGO	5	1	3241	3246	6	49	Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.—<br>Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.—<br>Emilia, run you to the citadel<br>And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.—<br>Will you go on afore? This is the night<br>That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
IAGO	5	2	3458	3459	2	19	I told him what I thought, and told no more<br>Than what he found himself was apt and true.
IAGO	5	2	3461	3461	1	2	I did.
IAGO	5	2	3465	3465	1	8	With Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.
IAGO	5	2	3477	3477	1	10	What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.
IAGO	5	2	3505	3505	1	4	Zounds, hold your peace!
IAGO	5	2	3510	3510	1	6	Be wise, and get you home.
IAGO	5	2	3519	3519	1	2	Villainous whore!
IAGO	5	2	3522	3522	1	3	Filth, thou liest!
IAGO	5	2	3585	3585	1	6	I bleed, sir, but not killed.
IAGO	5	2	3601	3602	2	17	Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.<br>From this time forth I never will speak word.
LODOVICO	4	1	2617	2617	1	5	God save you, worthy general.
LODOVICO	4	1	2619	2619	1	9	The Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you.
LODOVICO	4	1	2624	2624	1	7	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
LODOVICO	4	1	2632	2633	2	17	He did not call; he’s busy in the paper.<br>Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?
LODOVICO	4	1	2640	2642	3	20	May be the letter moved him.<br>For, as I think, they do command him home,<br>Deputing Cassio in his government.
LODOVICO	4	1	2650	2652	3	24	My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,<br>Though I should swear I saw ’t. ’Tis very much.<br>Make her amends. She weeps.
LODOVICO	4	1	2658	2659	2	12	Truly an obedient lady.<br>I do beseech your Lordship call her back.
LODOVICO	4	1	2663	2663	1	4	Who, I, my lord?
LODOVICO	4	1	2677	2681	5	39	Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate<br>Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature<br>Whom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue<br>The shot of accident nor dart of chance<br>Could neither graze nor pierce?
LODOVICO	4	1	2684	2684	1	10	Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
LODOVICO	4	1	2688	2688	1	4	What? Strike his wife?
LODOVICO	4	1	2691	2693	3	16	Is it his use?<br>Or did the letters work upon his blood<br>And new-create this fault?
LODOVICO	4	1	2701	2701	1	9	I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
LODOVICO	4	3	2979	2979	1	9	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
LODOVICO	4	3	2981	2981	1	8	Madam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.
LODOVICO	5	1	3140	3140	1	1	Hark!
LODOVICO	5	1	3142	3144	3	24	Two or three groan. ’Tis heavy night.<br>These may be counterfeits. Let’s think ’t unsafe<br>To come in to the cry without more help.
LODOVICO	5	1	3146	3146	1	1	Hark!
LODOVICO	5	1	3151	3151	1	4	We do not know.
LODOVICO	5	1	3156	3156	1	7	The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.
LODOVICO	5	1	3174	3174	1	7	As you shall prove us, praise us.
LODOVICO	5	1	3176	3176	1	2	He, sir.
LODOVICO	5	2	3579	3579	1	8	Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
LODOVICO	5	2	3581	3581	1	8	Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
LODOVICO	5	2	3584	3584	1	5	Wrench his sword from him.
LODOVICO	5	2	3588	3590	3	22	O thou Othello, that wert once so good,<br>Fall’n in the practice of a damnèd slave,<br>What shall be said to thee?
LODOVICO	5	2	3594	3595	2	15	This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.<br>Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?
LODOVICO	5	2	3603	3603	1	4	What? Not to pray?
LODOVICO	5	2	3606	3613	8	46	Sir,<br>You shall understand what hath befall’n,<br>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,<br>And here another. The one of<br>them imports<br>The death of Cassio, to be undertook<br>By Roderigo.
LODOVICO	5	2	3616	3620	5	34	Now here’s another discontented paper<br>Found in his pocket, too; and this it seems<br>Roderigo meant t’ have sent this damnèd villain,<br>But that, belike, Iago in the interim<br>Came in and satisfied him.
LODOVICO	5	2	3635	3642	8	65	You must forsake this room and go with us.<br>Your power and your command is taken off,<br>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br>If there be any cunning cruelty<br>That can torment him much and hold him long,<br>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br>Till that the nature of your fault be known<br>To the Venetian state.—Come, bring away.
LODOVICO	5	2	3664	3664	1	3	O bloody period!
LODOVICO	5	2	3670	3681	12	85	O Spartan dog,<br>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,<br>Look on the tragic loading of this bed.<br>This is thy work.—The object poisons sight.<br>Let it be hid.—Gratiano, keep the house,<br>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br>For they succeed on you. To you, lord<br>governor,<br>Remains the censure of this hellish villain.<br>The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it.<br>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state<br>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
MESSENGERS	1	3	368	370	3	22	The Ottomites, Reverend and Gracious,<br>Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,<br>Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
MESSENGERS	1	3	372	378	7	40	Of thirty sail; and now they do restem<br>Their backward course, bearing with frank<br>appearance<br>Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,<br>Your trusty and most valiant servitor,<br>With his free duty recommends you thus,<br>And prays you to believe him.
MESSENGERS	2	1	834	835	2	19	The town is empty; on the brow o’ th’ sea<br>Stand ranks of people, and they cry <span class="quote" data-words="2">A sail!</span>
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	777	777	1	9	What from the cape can you discern at sea?
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	781	785	5	42	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.<br>A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.<br>If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea,<br>What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,<br>Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	795	797	3	20	If that the Turkish fleet<br>Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.<br>It is impossible to bear it out.
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	803	803	1	4	How? Is this true?
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	809	809	1	9	I am glad on ’t. ’Tis a worthy governor.
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	814	820	7	53	Pray heaven he be;<br>For I have served him, and the man commands<br>Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!<br>As well to see the vessel that’s come in<br>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<br>Even till we make the main and th’ aerial blue<br>An indistinct regard.
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	828	828	1	4	Is he well shipped?
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	842	842	1	7	But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
MONTANO-OTH	2	1	857	857	1	3	What is she?
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1191	1192	2	14	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I<br>am a soldier.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1212	1213	2	10	I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you<br>justice.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1246	1246	1	9	To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1255	1255	1	5	But is he often thus?
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1259	1263	5	37	It were well<br>The General were put in mind of it.<br>Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature<br>Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio<br>And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1266	1270	5	34	And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor<br>Should hazard such a place as his own second<br>With one of an engraffed infirmity.<br>It were an honest action to say so<br>To the Moor.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1276	1276	1	4	What’s the matter, lieutenant?
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1281	1282	2	10	Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold<br>your hand.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1285	1285	1	4	Come, come, you’re drunk.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1295	1297	3	12	Zounds, I bleed<br>still.<br>I am hurt to th’ death. He dies!
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1331	1339	9	59	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.<br>Your officer lago can inform you,<br>While I spare speech, which something now offends<br>me,<br>Of all that I do know; nor know I aught<br>By me that’s said or done amiss this night,<br>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br>And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br>When violence assails us.
MONTANO-OTH	2	3	1354	1356	3	19	If partially affined, or leagued in office,<br>Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br>Thou art no soldier.
MONTANO-OTH	5	2	3450	3450	1	7	What is the matter? How now, general?
MONTANO-OTH	5	2	3472	3472	1	3	O monstrous act!
MONTANO-OTH	5	2	3532	3536	5	39	’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon<br>Which I have here recovered from the Moor.<br>Come, guard the door without. Let him not pass,<br>But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,<br>For ’tis a damnèd slave.
MUSICIANS	3	1	1538	1538	1	3	How, sir, how?
MUSICIANS	3	1	1540	1540	1	5	Ay, marry, are they, sir.
MUSICIANS	3	1	1542	1542	1	5	Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
MUSICIANS	3	1	1547	1547	1	5	Well, sir, we will not.
MUSICIANS	3	1	1551	1551	1	5	We have none such, sir.
OFFICERS	1	3	345	345	1	5	A messenger from the galleys.
OFFICERS	1	3	367	367	1	4	Here is more news.
OTHELLO	1	2	213	213	1	5	’Tis better as it is.
OTHELLO	1	2	226	238	13	93	Let him do his spite.<br>My services which I have done the signiory<br>Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know<br>(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,<br>I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being<br>From men of royal siege, and my demerits<br>May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<br>As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,<br>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<br>I would not my unhousèd free condition<br>Put into circumscription and confine<br>For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come<br>yond?
OTHELLO	1	2	241	243	3	21	Not I. I must be found.<br>My parts, my title, and my perfect soul<br>Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
OTHELLO	1	2	245	247	3	20	The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!<br>The goodness of the night upon you, friends.<br>What is the news?
OTHELLO	1	2	251	251	1	6	What is the matter, think you?
OTHELLO	1	2	262	264	3	21	’Tis well I am found by you.<br>I will but spend a word here in the house<br>And go with you.
OTHELLO	1	2	273	273	1	3	Have with you.
OTHELLO	1	2	277	277	1	3	Holla, stand there!
OTHELLO	1	2	282	285	4	23	Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust<br>them.<br>Good signior, you shall more command with years<br>Than with your weapons.
OTHELLO	1	2	307	311	5	36	Hold your hands,<br>Both you of my inclining and the rest.<br>Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<br>Without a prompter.—Whither will you that I go<br>To answer this your charge?
OTHELLO	1	2	315	319	5	31	What if I do obey?<br>How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,<br>Whose messengers are here about my side,<br>Upon some present business of the state,<br>To bring me to him?
OTHELLO	1	3	420	440	21	154	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br>My very noble and approved good masters:<br>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,<br>It is most true; true I have married her.<br>The very head and front of my offending<br>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br>And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;<br>For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,<br>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<br>Their dearest action in the tented field,<br>And little of this great world can I speak<br>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.<br>And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious<br>patience,<br>I will a round unvarnished tale deliver<br>Of my whole course of love—what drugs, what<br>charms,<br>What conjuration, and what mighty magic<br>(For such proceeding I am charged withal)<br>I won his daughter.
OTHELLO	1	3	463	469	7	51	I do beseech you,<br>Send for the lady to the Sagittary<br>And let her speak of me before her father.<br>If you do find me foul in her report,<br>The trust, the office I do hold of you,<br>Not only take away, but let your sentence<br>Even fall upon my life.
OTHELLO	1	3	471	476	6	50	Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.<br>And till she come, as truly as to heaven<br>I do confess the vices of my blood,<br>So justly to your grave ears I’ll present<br>How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,<br>And she in mine.
OTHELLO	1	3	478	525	48	346	Her father loved me, oft invited me,<br>Still questioned me the story of my life<br>From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes<br>That I have passed.<br>I ran it through, even from my boyish days<br>To th’ very moment that he bade me tell it,<br>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:<br>Of moving accidents by flood and field,<br>Of hairbreadth ’scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly<br>breach,<br>Of being taken by the insolent foe<br>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,<br>And portance in my traveler’s history,<br>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads<br>touch heaven,<br>It was my hint to speak—such was my process—<br>And of the cannibals that each other eat,<br>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br>Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to<br>hear<br>Would Desdemona seriously incline.<br>But still the house affairs would draw her thence,<br>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch<br>She’d come again, and with a greedy ear<br>Devour up my discourse. Which I, observing,<br>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>But not intentively. I did consent,<br>And often did beguile her of her tears<br>When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>That my youth suffered. My story being done,<br>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.<br>She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing<br>strange,<br>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.<br>She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished<br>That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked<br>me,<br>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br>I should but teach him how to tell my story,<br>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.<br>She loved me for the dangers I had passed,<br>And I loved her that she did pity them.<br>This only is the witchcraft I have used.<br>Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.
OTHELLO	1	3	591	601	11	71	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<br>Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<br>My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize<br>A natural and prompt alacrity<br>I find in hardness, and do undertake<br>This present wars against the Ottomites.<br>Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,<br>I crave fit disposition for my wife,<br>Due reference of place and exhibition,<br>With such accommodation and besort<br>As levels with her breeding.
OTHELLO	1	3	604	604	1	2	Nor I.
OTHELLO	1	3	624	638	15	109	Let her have your voice.<br>Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not<br>To please the palate of my appetite,<br>Nor to comply with heat (the young affects<br>In me defunct) and proper satisfaction,<br>But to be free and bounteous to her mind.<br>And heaven defend your good souls that you think<br>I will your serious and great business scant<br>For she is with me. No, when light-winged toys<br>Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness<br>My speculative and officed instruments,<br>That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<br>Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<br>And all indign and base adversities<br>Make head against my estimation.
OTHELLO	1	3	643	644	2	4	With all my<br>heart.
OTHELLO	1	3	650	655	6	35	So please your Grace, my<br>ancient.<br>A man he is of honesty and trust.<br>To his conveyance I assign my wife,<br>With what else needful your good Grace shall think<br>To be sent after me.
OTHELLO	1	3	664	671	8	61	My life upon her faith!<br>Honest Iago,<br>My Desdemona must I leave to thee.<br>I prithee let thy wife attend on her,<br>And bring them after in the best advantage.—<br>Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour<br>Of love, of worldly matters, and direction<br>To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
OTHELLO	2	1	973	973	1	4	O, my fair warrior!
OTHELLO	2	1	975	985	11	87	It gives me wonder great as my content<br>To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!<br>If after every tempest come such calms,<br>May the winds blow till they have wakened death,<br>And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas<br>Olympus high, and duck again as low<br>As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,<br>’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear<br>My soul hath her content so absolute<br>That not another comfort like to this<br>Succeeds in unknown fate.
OTHELLO	2	1	989	993	5	38	Amen to that, sweet powers!<br>I cannot speak enough of this content.<br>It stops me here; it is too much of joy.<br>And this, and this, the greatest discords be<br>That e’er our hearts shall make!
OTHELLO	2	1	997	1009	13	93	Come. Let us to the castle.—<br>News, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are<br>drowned.<br>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?—<br>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.<br>I have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,<br>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote<br>In mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago,<br>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.<br>Bring thou the master to the citadel.<br>He is a good one, and his worthiness<br>Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona.<br>Once more, well met at Cyprus.
OTHELLO	2	3	1123	1125	3	18	Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.<br>Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop<br>Not to outsport discretion.
OTHELLO	2	3	1129	1135	7	40	Iago is most honest.<br>Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest<br>Let me have speech with you. Come,<br>my dear love,<br>The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<br>That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—<br>Goodnight.
OTHELLO	2	3	1294	1294	1	5	What is the matter here?
OTHELLO	2	3	1298	1298	1	4	Hold, for your lives!
OTHELLO	2	3	1303	1312	10	83	Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?<br>Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that<br>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<br>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!<br>He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<br>Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<br>Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle<br>From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<br>Honest lago, that looks dead with grieving,<br>Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.
OTHELLO	2	3	1322	1322	1	8	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
OTHELLO	2	3	1324	1330	7	53	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.<br>The gravity and stillness of your youth<br>The world hath noted. And your name is great<br>In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter<br>That you unlace your reputation thus,<br>And spend your rich opinion for the name<br>Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.
OTHELLO	2	3	1340	1353	14	112	Now, by heaven,<br>My blood begins my safer guides to rule,<br>And passion, having my best judgment collied,<br>Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,<br>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br>How this foul rout began, who set it on;<br>And he that is approved in this offense,<br>Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,<br>Shall lose me. What, in a town of war<br>Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,<br>To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?<br>’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t?
OTHELLO	2	3	1384	1389	6	43	I know, Iago,<br>Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<br>Making it light to Cassio.Cassio, I love thee,<br>But nevermore be officer of mine.<br>Look if my gentle love be not raised up!<br>I’ll make thee an example.
OTHELLO	2	3	1391	1399	9	55	All’s well now,<br>sweeting.<br>Come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts,<br>Myself will be your surgeon.—Lead him off.<br>Iago, look with care about the town<br>And silence those whom this vile brawl<br>distracted.—<br>Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life<br>To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
OTHELLO	3	2	1597	1600	4	34	These letters give, Iago, to the pilot<br>And by him do my duties to the Senate.<br>That done, I will be walking on the works.<br>Repair there to me.
OTHELLO	3	2	1602	1602	1	7	This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?
OTHELLO	3	3	1641	1641	1	4	What dost thou say?
OTHELLO	3	3	1643	1643	1	8	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
OTHELLO	3	3	1647	1647	1	5	I do believe ’twas he.
OTHELLO	3	3	1651	1651	1	5	Who is ’t you mean?
OTHELLO	3	3	1659	1659	1	4	Went he hence now?
OTHELLO	3	3	1663	1663	1	7	Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.
OTHELLO	3	3	1665	1665	1	5	The sooner, sweet, for you.
OTHELLO	3	3	1667	1667	1	3	No, not tonight.
OTHELLO	3	3	1669	1670	2	13	I shall not dine at home;<br>I meet the captains at the citadel.
OTHELLO	3	3	1686	1687	2	14	Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;<br>I will deny thee nothing.
OTHELLO	3	3	1696	1698	3	21	I will deny thee nothing!<br>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br>To leave me but a little to myself.
OTHELLO	3	3	1700	1700	1	8	Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.
OTHELLO	3	3	1703	1705	3	21	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul<br>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,<br>Chaos is come again.
OTHELLO	3	3	1707	1707	1	5	What dost thou say, Iago?
OTHELLO	3	3	1710	1710	1	10	He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
OTHELLO	3	3	1713	1713	1	5	Why of thy thought, Iago?
OTHELLO	3	3	1715	1715	1	8	O yes, and went between us very oft.
OTHELLO	3	3	1717	1718	2	12	Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?<br>Is he not honest?
OTHELLO	3	3	1720	1720	1	3	Honest—ay, honest.
OTHELLO	3	3	1722	1722	1	4	What dost thou think?
OTHELLO	3	3	1724	1736	13	94	<span class="quote" data-words="3">Think, my lord?</span> By heaven, thou echo’st me<br>As if there were some monster in thy thought<br>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean<br>something.<br>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,<br>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?<br>And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br>In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Indeed?</span><br>And didst contract and purse thy brow together<br>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br>Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,<br>Show me thy thought.
OTHELLO	3	3	1738	1746	9	62	I think thou dost;<br>And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty<br>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them<br>breath,<br>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.<br>For such things in a false, disloyal knave<br>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,<br>They’re close dilations working from the heart<br>That passion cannot rule.
OTHELLO	3	3	1749	1749	1	4	I think so too.
OTHELLO	3	3	1752	1752	1	7	Certain, men should be what they seem.
OTHELLO	3	3	1754	1758	5	29	Nay, yet there’s more in this.<br>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of<br>thoughts<br>The worst of words.
OTHELLO	3	3	1770	1772	3	22	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br>If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear<br>A stranger to thy thoughts.
OTHELLO	3	3	1784	1784	1	4	What dost thou mean?
OTHELLO	3	3	1794	1794	1	6	By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.
OTHELLO	3	3	1797	1797	1	1	Ha?
OTHELLO	3	3	1804	1804	1	2	O misery!
OTHELLO	3	3	1810	1826	17	141	Why, why is this?<br>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,<br>To follow still the changes of the moon<br>With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt<br>Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat<br>When I shall turn the business of my soul<br>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br>Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous<br>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.<br>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.<br>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,<br>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,<br>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br>And on the proof, there is no more but this:<br>Away at once with love or jealousy.
OTHELLO	3	3	1840	1840	1	4	Dost thou say so?
OTHELLO	3	3	1844	1844	1	4	And so she did.
OTHELLO	3	3	1852	1852	1	6	I am bound to thee forever.
OTHELLO	3	3	1854	1854	1	6	Not a jot, not a jot.
OTHELLO	3	3	1861	1861	1	3	I will not.
OTHELLO	3	3	1867	1868	2	11	No, not much moved.<br>I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.
OTHELLO	3	3	1870	1870	1	7	And yet, how nature erring from itself—
OTHELLO	3	3	1882	1884	3	20	Farewell, farewell!<br>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.<br>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, lago.
OTHELLO	3	3	1886	1887	2	17	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<br>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
OTHELLO	3	3	1900	1900	1	4	Fear not my government.
OTHELLO	3	3	1902	1923	22	180	This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,<br>And knows all qualitieswith a learnèd spirit<br>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br>Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br>I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind<br>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br>And have not those soft parts of conversation<br>That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br>Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much—<br>She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief<br>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br>That we can call these delicate creatures ours<br>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad<br>And live upon the vapor of a dungeon<br>Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br>For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;<br>Prerogatived are they less than the base.<br>’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.<br>Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us<br>When we do quicken. Look where she comes.<br>If she be false, heaven mocks itself!<br>I’ll not believe ’t.
OTHELLO	3	3	1927	1927	1	4	I am to blame.
OTHELLO	3	3	1929	1929	1	8	I have a pain upon my forehead, here.
OTHELLO	3	3	1933	1935	3	18	Your napkin is too little.<br>Let it alone.<br>Come, I’ll go in with you.
OTHELLO	3	3	1986	1986	1	5	Ha, ha, false to me?
OTHELLO	3	3	1988	1990	3	24	Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.<br>I swear ’tis better to be much abused<br>Than but to know ’t a little.
OTHELLO	3	3	1992	1998	7	61	What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?<br>I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.<br>I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and<br>merry.<br>I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.<br>He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,<br>Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.
OTHELLO	3	3	2000	2012	13	89	I had been happy if the general camp,<br>Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<br>So I had nothing known. O, now, forever<br>Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!<br>Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars<br>That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!<br>Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,<br>The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,<br>The royal banner, and all quality,<br>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!<br>And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<br>Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,<br>Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!
OTHELLO	3	3	2014	2018	5	40	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!<br>Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,<br>Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,<br>Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<br>Than answer my waked wrath.
OTHELLO	3	3	2020	2022	3	30	Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it<br>That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br>To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!
OTHELLO	3	3	2024	2029	6	38	If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br>Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;<br>On horror’s head horrors accumulate;<br>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;<br>For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br>Greater than that.
OTHELLO	3	3	2038	2038	1	6	Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.
OTHELLO	3	3	2041	2048	8	67	By the world,<br>I think my wife be honest and think she is not.<br>I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<br>I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh<br>As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black<br>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<br>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<br>I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
OTHELLO	3	3	2052	2052	1	5	Would? Nay, and I will.
OTHELLO	3	3	2056	2056	1	4	Death and damnation! O!
OTHELLO	3	3	2069	2069	1	7	Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.
OTHELLO	3	3	2086	2086	1	3	O monstrous! Monstrous!
OTHELLO	3	3	2089	2090	2	16	But this denoted a foregone conclusion.<br>’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
OTHELLO	3	3	2093	2093	1	6	I’ll tear her all to pieces.
OTHELLO	3	3	2098	2098	1	10	I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.
OTHELLO	3	3	2102	2102	1	4	If it be that—
OTHELLO	3	3	2105	2113	9	67	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<br>Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,<br>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br>’Tis gone.<br>Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!<br>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br>For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!
OTHELLO	3	3	2115	2115	1	4	O, blood, blood, blood!
OTHELLO	3	3	2117	2127	11	74	Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,<br>Whose icy current and compulsive course<br>Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<br>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace<br>Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,<br>Till that a capable and wide revenge<br>Swallow them up.  Now by yond marble<br>heaven,<br>In the due reverence of a sacred vow,<br>I here engage my words.
OTHELLO	3	3	2136	2141	6	34	I greet thy love<br>Not with vain thanks but with acceptance<br>bounteous,<br>And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.<br>Within these three days let me hear thee say<br>That Cassio’s not alive.
OTHELLO	3	3	2144	2148	5	35	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn<br>her!<br>Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw<br>To furnish me with some swift means of death<br>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
OTHELLO	3	4	2186	2188	3	13	Well, my good lady. O, hardness to<br>dissemble!—<br>How do you, Desdemona?
OTHELLO	3	4	2190	2191	2	14	Give me your hand. This hand<br>is moist, my lady.
OTHELLO	3	4	2193	2199	7	44	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.<br>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires<br>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br>Much castigation, exercise devout;<br>For here’s a young and sweating devil here<br>That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,<br>A frank one.
OTHELLO	3	4	2202	2203	2	17	A liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,<br>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
OTHELLO	3	4	2205	2205	1	3	What promise, chuck?
OTHELLO	3	4	2207	2208	2	13	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.<br>Lend me thy handkerchief.
OTHELLO	3	4	2210	2210	1	5	That which I gave you.
OTHELLO	3	4	2212	2212	1	1	Not?
OTHELLO	3	4	2214	2228	15	119	That’s a fault. That handkerchief<br>Did an Egyptian to my mother give.<br>She was a charmer, and could almost read<br>The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept<br>it,<br>’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br>Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,<br>Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye<br>Should hold her loathèd, and his spirits should hunt<br>After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,<br>And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,<br>To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,<br>Make it a darling like your precious eye.<br>To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition<br>As nothing else could match.
OTHELLO	3	4	2230	2236	7	53	’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.<br>A sybil that had numbered in the world<br>The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br>In her prophetic fury sewed the work.<br>The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,<br>And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful<br>Conserved of maidens’ hearts.
OTHELLO	3	4	2238	2238	1	7	Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.
OTHELLO	3	4	2240	2240	1	2	Ha? Wherefore?
OTHELLO	3	4	2242	2242	1	13	Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?
OTHELLO	3	4	2244	2244	1	2	Say you?
OTHELLO	3	4	2246	2246	1	1	How?
OTHELLO	3	4	2248	2248	1	6	Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!
OTHELLO	3	4	2252	2253	2	8	Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind<br>misgives.
OTHELLO	3	4	2256	2256	1	2	The handkerchief!
OTHELLO	3	4	2258	2258	1	2	The handkerchief!
OTHELLO	3	4	2262	2262	1	2	The handkerchief!
OTHELLO	3	4	2264	2264	1	1	Zounds!
OTHELLO	4	1	2382	2382	1	3	Think so, Iago?
OTHELLO	4	1	2384	2384	1	3	An unauthorized kiss!
OTHELLO	4	1	2387	2391	5	31	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?<br>It is hypocrisy against the devil!<br>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<br>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt<br>heaven.
OTHELLO	4	1	2394	2394	1	2	What then?
OTHELLO	4	1	2397	2398	2	11	She is protectress of her honor, too.<br>May she give that?
OTHELLO	4	1	2402	2405	4	32	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<br>Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory<br>As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,<br>Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.
OTHELLO	4	1	2407	2407	1	5	That’s not so good now.
OTHELLO	4	1	2414	2414	1	4	Hath he said anything?
OTHELLO	4	1	2417	2417	1	4	What hath he said?
OTHELLO	4	1	2419	2419	1	2	What? What?
OTHELLO	4	1	2421	2421	1	2	With her?
OTHELLO	4	1	2423	2432	10	76	Lie with her? Lie on her? We say <span class="quote" data-words="3">lie on her</span><br>when they belie her. Lie with her—Zounds, that’s<br>fulsome! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief.<br>To confess and be hanged for his labor.<br>First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble<br>at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing<br>passion without some instruction. It is not<br>words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and<br>lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O,<br>devil!
OTHELLO	4	1	2452	2452	1	4	Dost thou mock me?
OTHELLO	4	1	2455	2455	1	8	A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.
OTHELLO	4	1	2458	2458	1	4	Did he confess it?
OTHELLO	4	1	2468	2468	1	6	O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.
OTHELLO	4	1	2485	2487	3	19	Dost thou hear, Iago,<br>I will be found most cunning in my patience,<br>But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.
OTHELLO	4	1	2507	2507	1	5	Look how he laughs already!
OTHELLO	4	1	2510	2510	1	9	Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
OTHELLO	4	1	2512	2513	2	14	Now he importunes him<br>To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.
OTHELLO	4	1	2517	2517	1	7	Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
OTHELLO	4	1	2521	2521	1	8	So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.
OTHELLO	4	1	2525	2525	1	5	Have you scored me? Well.
OTHELLO	4	1	2529	2529	1	8	Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.
OTHELLO	4	1	2535	2536	2	11	Crying, <span class="quote" data-words="3">O dear Cassio,</span> as it were; his<br>gesture imports it.
OTHELLO	4	1	2539	2541	3	26	Now he tells how she plucked him to my<br>chamber.—O, I see that nose of yours, but not that<br>dog I shall throw it to.
OTHELLO	4	1	2556	2556	1	7	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
OTHELLO	4	1	2568	2569	2	6	How shall I murder him,<br>Iago?
OTHELLO	4	1	2571	2571	1	2	O Iago!
OTHELLO	4	1	2573	2573	1	3	Was that mine?
OTHELLO	4	1	2577	2578	2	16	I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine<br>woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!
OTHELLO	4	1	2580	2584	5	49	Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned<br>tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned<br>to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the<br>world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by<br>an emperor’s side and command him tasks.
OTHELLO	4	1	2586	2589	4	35	Hang her, I do but say what she is! So<br>delicate with her needle, an admirable musician—<br>O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!<br>Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!
OTHELLO	4	1	2591	2592	2	13	O, a thousand, a thousand times!—And then<br>of so gentle a condition!
OTHELLO	4	1	2594	2595	2	17	Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it,<br>Iago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
OTHELLO	4	1	2599	2599	1	8	I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?
OTHELLO	4	1	2601	2601	1	3	With mine officer!
OTHELLO	4	1	2603	2605	3	24	Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not<br>expostulate with her lest her body and beauty<br>unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.
OTHELLO	4	1	2608	2609	2	9	Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very<br>good.
OTHELLO	4	1	2612	2613	2	10	Excellent good.<br>What trumpet is that same?
OTHELLO	4	1	2618	2618	1	5	With all my heart, sir.
OTHELLO	4	1	2620	2620	1	7	I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
OTHELLO	4	1	2628	2628	1	5	Are you sure of that?
OTHELLO	4	1	2630	2630	2	9	<span class="quote" data-words="9">This fail you not to do, as youwill</span>—
OTHELLO	4	1	2636	2636	1	3	Fire and brimstone!
OTHELLO	4	1	2638	2638	1	3	Are you wise?
OTHELLO	4	1	2644	2644	1	1	Indeed?
OTHELLO	4	1	2646	2646	1	7	I am glad to see you mad.
OTHELLO	4	1	2648	2648	1	1	Devil!
OTHELLO	4	1	2653	2656	4	24	O, devil, devil!<br>If that the Earth could teem with woman’s tears,<br>Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.<br>Out of my sight!
OTHELLO	4	1	2660	2660	1	1	Mistress.
OTHELLO	4	1	2662	2662	1	6	What would you with her, sir?
OTHELLO	4	1	2664	2676	13	100	Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.<br>Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,<br>And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep.<br>And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient.<br>Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.—<br>Concerning this, sir—O, well-painted passion!—<br>I am commanded home.—Get you away.<br>I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate<br>And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!<br>Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight<br>I do entreat that we may sup together.<br>You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and<br>monkeys!
OTHELLO	4	2	2702	2702	1	5	You have seen nothing then?
OTHELLO	4	2	2704	2704	1	8	Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
OTHELLO	4	2	2707	2707	1	5	What, did they never whisper?
OTHELLO	4	2	2709	2709	1	7	Nor send you out o’ th’ way?
OTHELLO	4	2	2711	2711	1	10	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
OTHELLO	4	2	2713	2713	1	2	That’s strange.
OTHELLO	4	2	2722	2726	5	45	Bid her come hither. Go.<br>She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd<br>That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,<br>A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.<br>And yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.
OTHELLO	4	2	2728	2728	1	5	Pray you, chuck, come hither.
OTHELLO	4	2	2731	2731	1	9	Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.
OTHELLO	4	2	2733	2737	5	25	Some of your function,<br>mistress.<br>Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.<br>Cough, or cry <span class="quote" data-words="1">hem,</span> if anybody come.<br>Your mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.
OTHELLO	4	2	2741	2741	1	4	Why? What art thou?
OTHELLO	4	2	2743	2747	5	27	Come, swear it. Damn thyself,<br>Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves<br>Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double<br>damned.<br>Swear thou art honest.
OTHELLO	4	2	2749	2749	1	9	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
OTHELLO	4	2	2751	2751	1	5	Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!
OTHELLO	4	2	2758	2775	18	145	Had it pleased heaven<br>To try me with affliction, had they rained<br>All kind of sores and shames on my bare head,<br>Steeped me in poverty to the very lips,<br>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<br>I should have found in some place of my soul<br>A drop of patience. But alas, to make me<br>A fixèd figure for the time of scorn<br>To point his slow unmoving finger at—<br>Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.<br>But there where I have garnered up my heart,<br>Where either I must live or bear no life,<br>The fountain from the which my current runs<br>Or else dries up—to be discarded thence,<br>Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<br>To knot and gender in—turn thy complexion there,<br>Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,<br>Ay, there look grim as hell.
OTHELLO	4	2	2777	2781	5	38	O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,<br>That quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,<br>Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet<br>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst<br>ne’er been born!
OTHELLO	4	2	2783	2793	11	78	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,<br>Made to write <span class="quote" data-words="1">whore</span> upon? What committed?<br>Committed? O thou public commoner,<br>I should make very forges of my cheeks<br>That would to cinders burn up modesty,<br>Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?<br>Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;<br>The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<br>Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth<br>And will not hear ’t. What committed?<br>Impudent strumpet!
OTHELLO	4	2	2795	2795	1	5	Are not you a strumpet?
OTHELLO	4	2	2800	2800	1	4	What, not a whore?
OTHELLO	4	2	2802	2802	1	3	Is ’t possible?
OTHELLO	4	2	2804	2811	8	64	I cry you mercy, then.<br>I took you for that cunning whore of Venice<br>That married with Othello.—You, mistress,<br>That have the office opposite to Saint Peter<br>And keeps the gate of hell—you, you, ay, you!<br>We have done our course. There’s money for your<br>pains.<br>I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.
OTHELLO	4	3	2980	2980	1	9	O, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.
OTHELLO	4	3	2983	2983	1	6	Will you walk, sir?—O, Desdemona—
OTHELLO	4	3	2985	2987	3	20	Get you to bed on th’ instant. I will be<br>returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.<br>Look ’t be done.
OTHELLO	5	1	3125	3125	1	8	The voice of Cassio! Iago keeps his word.
OTHELLO	5	1	3127	3127	1	4	It is even so.
OTHELLO	5	1	3129	3136	8	52	’Tis he! O brave Iago, honest and just,<br>That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!<br>Thou teachest me.—Minion, your dear lies dead,<br>And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.<br>Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are<br>blotted.<br>Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be<br>spotted.
OTHELLO	5	2	3247	3270	24	197	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.<br>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.<br>It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,<br>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br>And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br>Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.<br>Put out the light, and then put out the light.<br>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br>I can again thy former light restore<br>Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,<br>Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,<br>I know not where is that Promethean heat<br>That can thy light relume. When I have plucked the<br>rose,<br>I cannot give it vital growth again.<br>It needs must wither. I’ll smell it on the tree.<br>O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br>Justice to break her sword! One<br>more, one more.<br>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee<br>And love thee after. One more, and this the last.<br>So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,<br>But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly:<br>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
OTHELLO	5	2	3272	3272	1	2	Ay, Desdemona.
OTHELLO	5	2	3274	3274	1	5	Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?
OTHELLO	5	2	3276	3278	3	18	If you bethink yourself of any crime<br>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<br>Solicit for it straight.
OTHELLO	5	2	3281	3283	3	26	Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.<br>I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.<br>No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
OTHELLO	5	2	3285	3285	1	3	Ay, I do.
OTHELLO	5	2	3287	3287	1	5	Amen, with all my heart.
OTHELLO	5	2	3289	3289	1	1	Humh.
OTHELLO	5	2	3294	3294	1	4	Think on thy sins.
OTHELLO	5	2	3296	3296	1	6	Ay, and for that thou diest.
OTHELLO	5	2	3302	3302	1	4	Peace, and be still.
OTHELLO	5	2	3304	3306	3	13	That handkerchief<br>Which I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav’st to<br>Cassio.
OTHELLO	5	2	3309	3310	2	13	Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.<br>Thou art on thy deathbed.
OTHELLO	5	2	3312	3316	5	32	Yes, presently.<br>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.<br>For to deny each article with oath<br>Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br>That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
OTHELLO	5	2	3318	3318	1	3	I say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Amen.</span>
OTHELLO	5	2	3323	3327	5	37	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand!<br>O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart<br>And mak’st me call what I intend to do<br>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!<br>I saw the handkerchief!
OTHELLO	5	2	3331	3331	1	3	He hath confessed.
OTHELLO	5	2	3333	3333	1	5	That he hath used thee.
OTHELLO	5	2	3335	3335	1	1	Ay.
OTHELLO	5	2	3337	3338	2	12	No. His mouth is stopped.<br>Honest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.
OTHELLO	5	2	3340	3341	2	14	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge<br>Had stomach for them all.
OTHELLO	5	2	3343	3343	1	9	Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?
OTHELLO	5	2	3345	3345	1	2	Down, strumpet!
OTHELLO	5	2	3347	3347	1	4	Nay, if you strive—
OTHELLO	5	2	3349	3349	1	6	Being done, there is no pause.
OTHELLO	5	2	3351	3351	1	4	It is too late.
OTHELLO	5	2	3353	3356	4	28	What noise is this?—Not dead? Not yet quite dead?<br>I that am cruel am yet merciful.<br>I would not have thee linger in thy pain.<br>So, so.
OTHELLO	5	2	3358	3359	2	2	Who’s<br>there?
OTHELLO	5	2	3361	3371	11	92	Yes. ’Tis Emilia.—By and by.—She’s dead.<br>’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.<br>The noise was here. Ha, no more moving?<br>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were ’t good?<br>I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?<br>If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.<br>My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.<br>O insupportable! O heavy hour!<br>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse<br>Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe<br>Should yawn at alteration.
OTHELLO	5	2	3374	3377	4	28	I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.—<br>Soft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.—<br>Where art thou?<br>What’s the matter with thee now?
OTHELLO	5	2	3379	3379	1	2	What? Now?
OTHELLO	5	2	3381	3383	3	21	It is the very error of the moon.<br>She comes more nearer earth than she was wont<br>And makes men mad.
OTHELLO	5	2	3386	3386	1	5	Roderigo killed? And Cassio killed?
OTHELLO	5	2	3388	3389	2	13	Not Cassio killed? Then murder’s out of tune,<br>And sweet revenge grows harsh.
OTHELLO	5	2	3392	3392	1	2	That? What?
OTHELLO	5	2	3400	3400	1	6	Why, how should she be murdered?
OTHELLO	5	2	3403	3403	1	9	You heard her say herself, it was not I.
OTHELLO	5	2	3405	3406	2	13	She’s like a liar gone to burning hell!<br>’Twas I that killed her.
OTHELLO	5	2	3408	3408	1	9	She turned to folly, and she was a whore.
OTHELLO	5	2	3410	3410	1	5	She was false as water.
OTHELLO	5	2	3413	3416	4	33	Cassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.<br>O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell<br>But that I did proceed upon just grounds<br>To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
OTHELLO	5	2	3418	3418	1	2	Thy husband.
OTHELLO	5	2	3420	3423	4	28	Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,<br>If heaven would make me such another world<br>Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,<br>I’d not have sold her for it.
OTHELLO	5	2	3425	3427	3	23	Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.<br>An honest man he is, and hates the slime<br>That sticks on filthy deeds.
OTHELLO	5	2	3429	3430	2	9	What needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy<br>husband.
OTHELLO	5	2	3433	3435	3	17	He, woman.<br>I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?<br>My friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.
OTHELLO	5	2	3439	3439	1	1	Hah?
OTHELLO	5	2	3443	3443	1	4	Peace, you were best!
OTHELLO	5	2	3470	3470	1	8	Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
OTHELLO	5	2	3481	3481	1	3	O, O, O! 
OTHELLO	5	2	3485	3489	5	30	O, she was foul!—<br>I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,<br>Whose breath indeed these hands have newly<br>stopped.<br>I know this act shows horrible and grim.
OTHELLO	5	2	3496	3503	8	59	’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows<br>That she with Cassio hath the act of shame<br>A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,<br>And she did gratify his amorous works<br>With that recognizance and pledge of love<br>Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.<br>It was a handkerchief, an antique token<br>My father gave my mother.
OTHELLO	5	2	3527	3528	2	14	Are there no stones in heaven<br>But what serves for the thunder?—Precious villain!
OTHELLO	5	2	3537	3540	4	22	I am not valiant neither,<br>But every puny whipster gets my sword.<br>But why should honor outlive honesty?<br>Let it go all.
OTHELLO	5	2	3548	3550	3	26	I have another weapon in this chamber.<br>It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook’s temper.<br>O, here it is.—Uncle, I must come forth.
OTHELLO	5	2	3553	3554	2	18	Look in upon me, then, and speak with me,<br>Or naked as I am I will assault thee.
OTHELLO	5	2	3556	3578	23	190	Behold, I have a weapon.<br>A better never did itself sustain<br>Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day<br>That with this little arm and this good sword<br>I have made my way through more impediments<br>Than twenty times your stop. But—O vain boast!—<br>Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.<br>Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.<br>Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt<br>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br>Do you go back dismayed? ’Tis a lost fear.<br>Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,<br>And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,<br>Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,<br>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?<br>Even like thy chastity.—O cursèd, cursèd slave!—<br>Whip me, you devils,<br>From the possession of this heavenly sight!<br>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,<br>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!
OTHELLO	5	2	3580	3580	1	8	That’s he that was Othello. Here I am.
OTHELLO	5	2	3582	3583	2	20	I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.—<br>If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
OTHELLO	5	2	3586	3587	2	17	I am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,<br>For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.
OTHELLO	5	2	3591	3593	3	18	Why, anything.<br>An honorable murderer, if you will,<br>For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.
OTHELLO	5	2	3596	3596	1	1	Ay.
OTHELLO	5	2	3598	3600	3	25	I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
OTHELLO	5	2	3605	3605	1	4	Well, thou dost best.
OTHELLO	5	2	3614	3614	1	2	O villain!
OTHELLO	5	2	3621	3623	3	15	O, thou pernicious caitiff!—<br>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br>That was my wife’s?
OTHELLO	5	2	3628	3628	1	4	O fool, fool, fool!
OTHELLO	5	2	3643	3663	21	152	Soft you. A word or two before you go.<br>I have done the state some service, and they<br>know ’t.<br>No more of that. I pray you in your letters,<br>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br>Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak<br>Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;<br>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,<br>Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br>Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away<br>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued<br>eyes,<br>Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br>Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br>Their medicinable gum. Set you down this.<br>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br>Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk<br>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br>I took by th’ throat the circumcisèd dog,<br>And smote him, thus.
OTHELLO	5	2	3666	3667	2	20	I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,<br>Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
SAILORS	1	3	344	344	1	6	What ho, what ho, what ho!
SAILORS	1	3	347	349	3	18	The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes.<br>So was I bid report here to the state<br>By Signior Angelo.
SECOND_GENTLEMAN	2	1	786	794	9	56	A segregation of the Turkish fleet.<br>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,<br>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,<br>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous<br>mane,<br>Seems to cast water on the burning Bear<br>And quench the guards of th’ ever-fixèd pole.<br>I never did like molestation view<br>On the enchafèd flood.
SECOND_GENTLEMAN	2	1	837	838	2	11	They do discharge their shot of courtesy.<br>Our friends, at least.
SECOND_GENTLEMAN	2	1	841	841	1	2	I shall.
SECOND_GENTLEMAN	2	1	849	849	1	7	’Tis one Iago, ancient to the General.
SECOND_GENTLEMAN	2	1	881	882	2	12	They give their greeting to the citadel.<br>This likewise is a friend.
SECOND_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	335	339	5	38	And mine, two hundred.<br>But though they jump not on a just account<br>(As in these cases, where the aim reports<br>’Tis oft with difference), yet do they all confirm<br>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
SECOND_SENATOR-OTH	1	3	417	417	1	6	We are very sorry for ’t.
THIRD_GENTLEMAN	2	1	798	802	5	36	News, lads! Our wars are done.<br>The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks<br>That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice<br>Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance<br>On most part of their fleet.
THIRD_GENTLEMAN	2	1	804	808	5	33	The ship is here put in,<br>A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,<br>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<br>Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,<br>And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
THIRD_GENTLEMAN	2	1	810	813	4	32	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort<br>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly<br>And prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted<br>With foul and violent tempest.
THIRD_GENTLEMAN	2	1	821	823	3	12	Come, let’s do so;<br>For every minute is expectancy<br>Of more arrivance.
