AMBASSADORS	5	2	4125	4130	6	40	The sight is dismal,<br>And our affairs from England come too late.<br>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing<br>To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,<br>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.<br>Where should we have our thanks?
BARNARDO	1	1	1	1	1	2	Who’s there?
BARNARDO	1	1	10	10	1	5	Have you had quiet guard?
BARNARDO	1	1	12	14	3	19	Well, good night.<br>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
BARNARDO	1	1	120	123	4	35	I think it be no other but e’en so.<br>Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>Comes armèd through our watch so like the king<br>That was and is the question of these wars.
BARNARDO	1	1	155	155	1	2	’Tis here.
BARNARDO	1	1	162	162	1	9	It was about to speak when the cock crew.
BARNARDO	1	1	23	23	1	5	Say, what, is Horatio there?
BARNARDO	1	1	25	25	1	5	Welcome, Horatio.—Welcome, good Marcellus.
BARNARDO	1	1	27	27	1	4	I have seen nothing.
BARNARDO	1	1	3	3	1	4	Long live the King!
BARNARDO	1	1	36	39	4	24	Sit down awhile,<br>And let us once again assail your ears,<br>That are so fortified against our story,<br>What we have two nights seen.
BARNARDO	1	1	42	46	5	35	Last night of all,<br>When yond same star that’s westward from the pole<br>Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven<br>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>The bell then beating one—
BARNARDO	1	1	48	48	1	9	In the same figure like the King that’s dead.
BARNARDO	1	1	5	5	1	1	He.
BARNARDO	1	1	50	50	1	9	Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
BARNARDO	1	1	52	52	1	5	It would be spoke to.
BARNARDO	1	1	60	60	1	4	See, it stalks away.
BARNARDO	1	1	63	65	3	20	How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.<br>Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>What think you on ’t?
BARNARDO	1	1	7	7	1	9	’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
BARNARDO	1	2	429	429	1	4	We do, my lord.
BARNARDO	1	2	431	431	1	3	Armed, my lord.
BARNARDO	1	2	433	433	1	6	My lord, from head to foot.
BARNARDO	1	2	447	447	1	2	Longer, longer.
BARNARDO	1	2	465	465	1	5	Our duty to your Honor.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2838	2838	1	6	I will do ’t, my lord.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2841	2841	1	5	They are of Norway, sir.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2843	2843	1	5	Against some part of Poland.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2845	2845	1	6	The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2848	2853	6	53	Truly to speak, and with no addition,<br>We go to gain a little patch of ground<br>That hath in it no profit but the name.<br>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;<br>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole<br>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2855	2855	1	5	Yes, it is already garrisoned.
CAPTAIN-HAM	4	4	2861	2861	1	5	God be wi’ you, sir.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	191	229	39	303	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death<br>The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom<br>To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>That we with wisest sorrow think on him<br>Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>Have we (as ’twere with a defeated joy,<br>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>In equal scale weighing delight and dole)<br>Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred<br>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,<br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth<br>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death<br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>Colleaguèd with this dream of his advantage,<br>He hath not failed to pester us with message<br>Importing the surrender of those lands<br>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>To our most valiant brother—so much for him.<br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.<br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,<br>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears<br>Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress<br>His further gait herein, in that the levies,<br>The lists, and full proportions are all made<br>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch<br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,<br>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,<br>Giving to you no further personal power<br>To business with the King more than the scope<br>Of these dilated articles allow.<br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	231	241	11	84	We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.<br>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?<br>You told us of some suit. What is ’t, Laertes?<br>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane<br>And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,<br>Laertes,<br>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>The head is not more native to the heart,<br>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	249	249	1	8	Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	254	256	3	25	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,<br>And thy best graces spend it at thy will.—<br>But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son—
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	258	258	1	10	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	280	311	32	243	’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,<br>Hamlet,<br>To give these mourning duties to your father.<br>But you must know your father lost a father,<br>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>In filial obligation for some term<br>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever<br>In obstinate condolement is a course<br>Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief.<br>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>An understanding simple and unschooled.<br>For what we know must be and is as common<br>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,<br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>To reason most absurd, whose common theme<br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>From the first corse till he that died today,<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">This must be so.</span> We pray you, throw to earth<br>This unprevailing woe and think of us<br>As of a father; for let the world take note,<br>You are the most immediate to our throne,<br>And with no less nobility of love<br>Than that which dearest father bears his son<br>Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>It is most retrograde to our desire,<br>And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	1	2	315	322	8	60	Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.<br>Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.<br>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof<br>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today<br>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,<br>Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1065	1082	18	143	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.<br>Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br>The need we have to use you did provoke<br>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br>Of Hamlet’s transformation, so call it,<br>Sith nor th’ exterior nor the inward man<br>Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him<br>So much from th’ understanding of himself<br>I cannot dream of. I entreat you both<br>That, being of so young days brought up with him<br>And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,<br>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br>Some little time, so by your companies<br>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather<br>So much as from occasion you may glean,<br>Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus<br>That, opened, lies within our remedy.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1099	1099	1	5	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1109	1109	1	9	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1117	1117	1	10	O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1120	1122	3	29	Thyself do grace to them and bring them in.<br>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found<br>The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1125	1127	3	23	Well, we shall sift him.<br>Welcome, my good friends.<br>Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1150	1155	6	38	It likes us well,<br>And, at our more considered time, we’ll read,<br>Answer, and think upon this business.<br>Meantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.<br>Go to your rest. At night we’ll feast together.<br>Most welcome home!
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1201	1201	1	7	But how hath she received his love?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1203	1203	1	7	As of a man faithful and honorable.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1225	1225	1	5	Do you think ’tis this?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1231	1231	1	4	Not that I know.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1236	1236	1	6	How may we try it further?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	2	2	1246	1246	1	4	We will try it.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1699	1702	4	30	And can you by no drift of conference<br>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,<br>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet<br>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1724	1727	4	29	With all my heart, and it doth much content me<br>To hear him so inclined.<br>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge<br>And drive his purpose into these delights.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1729	1738	10	66	Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,<br>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,<br>That he, as ’twere by accident, may here<br>Affront Ophelia.<br>Her father and myself, lawful espials,<br>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,<br>We may of their encounter frankly judge<br>And gather by him, as he is behaved,<br>If ’t be th’ affliction of his love or no<br>That thus he suffers for.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1754	1760	7	43	O, ’tis too true!<br>How smart a lash that speech doth give my<br>conscience.<br>The harlot’s cheek beautied with plast’ring art<br>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it<br>Than is my deed to my most painted word.<br>O heavy burden!
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1874	1887	14	107	Love? His affections do not that way tend;<br>Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,<br>Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul<br>O’er which his melancholy sits on brood,<br>And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose<br>Will be some danger; which for to prevent,<br>I have in quick determination<br>Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England<br>For the demand of our neglected tribute.<br>Haply the seas, and countries different,<br>With variable objects, shall expel<br>This something-settled matter in his heart,<br>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus<br>From fashion of himself. What think you on ’t?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	1	1900	1901	2	12	It shall be so.<br>Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	2	1999	1999	1	5	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	2	2003	2004	2	12	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These<br>words are not mine.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	2	2157	2158	2	11	Have you heard the argument? Is there no<br>offense in ’t?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	2	2161	2161	1	6	What do you call the play?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	2	2196	2196	1	5	Give me some light. Away!
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	3	2334	2340	7	52	I like him not, nor stands it safe with us<br>To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.<br>I your commission will forthwith dispatch,<br>And he to England shall along with you.<br>The terms of our estate may not endure<br>Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow<br>Out of his brows.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	3	2358	2360	3	22	Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,<br>For we will fetters put about this fear,<br>Which now goes too free-footed.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	3	2372	2409	38	301	Thanks, dear my lord.<br>O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;<br>It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t,<br>A brother’s murder. Pray can I not,<br>Though inclination be as sharp as will.<br>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,<br>And, like a man to double business bound,<br>I stand in pause where I shall first begin<br>And both neglect. What if this cursèd hand<br>Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood?<br>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens<br>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy<br>But to confront the visage of offense?<br>And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,<br>To be forestallèd ere we come to fall,<br>Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up.<br>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer<br>Can serve my turn? <span class="quote" data-words="5">Forgive me my foul murder</span>?<br>That cannot be, since I am still possessed<br>Of those effects for which I did the murder:<br>My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.<br>May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?<br>In the corrupted currents of this world,<br>Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,<br>And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself<br>Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above:<br>There is no shuffling; there the action lies<br>In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,<br>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,<br>To give in evidence. What then? What rests?<br>Try what repentance can. What can it not?<br>Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?<br>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br>O limèd soul, that, struggling to be free,<br>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.<br>Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel<br>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe.<br>All may be well.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	3	3	2435	2436	2	15	My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;<br>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	1	2677	2679	3	20	There’s matter in these sighs; these profound heaves<br>You must translate; ’tis fit we understand them.<br>Where is your son?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	1	2682	2682	1	5	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	1	2689	2700	12	97	O heavy deed!<br>It had been so with us, had we been there.<br>His liberty is full of threats to all—<br>To you yourself, to us, to everyone.<br>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?<br>It will be laid to us, whose providence<br>Should have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt<br>This mad young man. But so much was our love,<br>We would not understand what was most fit,<br>But, like the owner of a foul disease,<br>To keep it from divulging, let it feed<br>Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	1	2705	2722	18	148	O Gertrude, come away!<br>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch<br>But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed<br>We must with all our majesty and skill<br>Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!<br>Friends both, go join you with some further aid.<br>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,<br>And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him.<br>Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body<br>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.<br>Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends<br>And let them know both what we mean to do<br>And what’s untimely done. <br>Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,<br>As level as the cannon to his blank<br>Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name<br>And hit the woundless ear. O, come away!<br>My soul is full of discord and dismay.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2754	2765	12	92	I have sent to seek him and to find the body.<br>How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!<br>Yet must not we put the strong law on him.<br>He’s loved of the distracted multitude,<br>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;<br>And, where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed,<br>But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,<br>This sudden sending him away must seem<br>Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown<br>By desperate appliance are relieved<br>Or not at all.<br>How now, what hath befallen?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2768	2768	1	4	But where is he?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2770	2770	1	4	Bring him before us.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2772	2772	1	4	Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2774	2774	1	3	At supper where?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2782	2782	1	2	Alas, alas!
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2786	2786	1	6	What dost thou mean by this?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2789	2789	1	3	Where is Polonius?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2795	2795	1	4	Go, seek him there.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2797	2804	8	49	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety<br>(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve<br>For that which thou hast done) must send thee<br>hence<br>With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.<br>The bark is ready, and the wind at help,<br>Th’ associates tend, and everything is bent<br>For England.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2806	2806	1	2	Ay, Hamlet.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2808	2808	1	8	So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2812	2812	1	4	Thy loving father, Hamlet.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	3	2816	2830	15	130	Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.<br>Delay it not. I’ll have him hence tonight.<br>Away, for everything is sealed and done<br>That else leans on th’ affair. Pray you, make haste.<br>And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught<br>(As my great power thereof may give thee sense,<br>Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red<br>After the Danish sword, and thy free awe<br>Pays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set<br>Our sovereign process, which imports at full,<br>By letters congruing to that effect,<br>The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,<br>For like the hectic in my blood he rages,<br>And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,<br>Howe’er my haps, my joys will ne’er begin.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	2945	2945	1	5	How do you, pretty lady?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	2949	2949	1	4	Conceit upon her father.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	2960	2960	1	2	Pretty Ophelia—
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	2971	2971	1	6	How long hath she been thus?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	2978	3002	25	178	Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.<br>O, this is the poison of deep grief. It springs<br>All from her father’s death, and now behold!<br>O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br>When sorrows come, they come not single spies,<br>But in battalions: first, her father slain;<br>Next, your son gone, and he most violent author<br>Of his own just remove; the people muddied,<br>Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and<br>whispers<br>For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but<br>greenly<br>In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia<br>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br>Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;<br>Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>Her brother is in secret come from France,<br>Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br>And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,<br>Wherein necessity, of matter beggared,<br>Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br>In ear and ear. O, my dear Gertrude, this,<br>Like to a murd’ring piece, in many places<br>Gives me superfluous death.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3004	3006	3	17	Attend!<br>Where is my Switzers? Let them guard the door.<br>What is the matter?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3020	3020	1	4	The doors are broke.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3034	3042	9	55	What is the cause, Laertes,<br>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—<br>Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.<br>There’s such divinity doth hedge a king<br>That treason can but peep to what it would,<br>Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,<br>Why thou art thus incensed.—Let him go,<br>Gertrude.—<br>Speak, man.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3044	3044	1	1	Dead.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3046	3046	1	5	Let him demand his fill.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3054	3054	1	4	Who shall stay you?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3058	3063	6	31	Good Laertes,<br>If you desire to know the certainty<br>Of your dear father, is ’t writ in your revenge<br>That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and<br>foe,<br>Winner and loser?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3065	3065	1	5	Will you know them, then?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3069	3074	6	42	Why, now you speak<br>Like a good child and a true gentleman.<br>That I am guiltless of your father’s death<br>And am most sensibly in grief for it,<br>It shall as level to your judgment ’pear<br>As day does to your eye.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3125	3135	11	89	Laertes, I must commune with your grief,<br>Or you deny me right. Go but apart,<br>Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,<br>And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.<br>If by direct or by collateral hand<br>They find us touched, we will our kingdom give,<br>Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,<br>To you in satisfaction; but if not,<br>Be you content to lend your patience to us,<br>And we shall jointly labor with your soul<br>To give it due content.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	5	3142	3144	3	19	So you shall,<br>And where th’ offense is, let the great ax fall.<br>I pray you, go with me.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3179	3183	5	37	Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,<br>And you must put me in your heart for friend,<br>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,<br>That he which hath your noble father slain<br>Pursued my life.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3189	3204	16	134	O, for two special reasons,<br>Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,<br>But yet to me they’re strong. The Queen his mother<br>Lives almost by his looks, and for myself<br>(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),<br>She is so conjunctive to my life and soul<br>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br>I could not but by her. The other motive<br>Why to a public count I might not go<br>Is the great love the general gender bear him,<br>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br>Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br>Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,<br>Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,<br>Would have reverted to my bow again,<br>But not where I have aimed them.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3210	3216	7	65	Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think<br>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull<br>That we can let our beard be shook with danger<br>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.<br>I loved your father, and we love ourself,<br>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—<br>How now? What news?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3220	3220	1	5	From Hamlet? Who brought them?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3224	3229	10	71	Laertes, you shall hear<br>them.—<br>Leave us.<br><span class="letter" data-words="42">High and mighty, you shall know I am setnaked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to<br>see your kingly eyes, when I shall (first asking your<br>pardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden<br>and more strange return. Hamlet.</span><br>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?<br>Or is it some abuse and no such thing?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3235	3237	3	16	’Tis Hamlet’s character. <span class="quote" data-words="1">Naked</span>—<br>And in a postscript here, he says <span class="quote" data-words="1">alone.</span><br>Can you advise me?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3242	3244	3	19	If it be so, Laertes<br>(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),<br>Will you be ruled by me?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3247	3254	8	66	To thine own peace. If he be now returned,<br>As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br>No more to undertake it, I will work him<br>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br>Under the which he shall not choose but fall;<br>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice<br>And call it accident.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3258	3264	7	50	It falls right.<br>You have been talked of since your travel much,<br>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality<br>Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts<br>Did not together pluck such envy from him<br>As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br>Of the unworthiest siege.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3266	3279	14	111	A very ribbon in the cap of youth—<br>Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes<br>The light and careless livery that it wears<br>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br>Importing health and graveness. Two months since<br>Here was a gentleman of Normandy.<br>I have seen myself, and served against, the French,<br>And they can well on horseback, but this gallant<br>Had witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat,<br>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse<br>As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured<br>With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought<br>That I in forgery of shapes and tricks<br>Come short of what he did.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3281	3281	1	2	A Norman.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3283	3283	1	3	The very same.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3286	3298	13	88	He made confession of you<br>And gave you such a masterly report<br>For art and exercise in your defense,<br>And for your rapier most especial,<br>That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed<br>If one could match you. The ’scrimers of their<br>nation<br>He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br>That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br>Your sudden coming-o’er, to play with you.<br>Now out of this—
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3300	3302	3	21	Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br>A face without a heart?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3304	3321	18	139	Not that I think you did not love your father,<br>But that I know love is begun by time<br>And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>There lives within the very flame of love<br>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,<br>And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,<br>Dies in his own too-much. That we would do<br>We should do when we would; for this <span class="quote" data-words="1">would</span><br>changes<br>And hath abatements and delays as many<br>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>And then this <span class="quote" data-words="1">should</span> is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th’ ulcer:<br>Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake<br>To show yourself indeed your father’s son<br>More than in words?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3323	3336	14	102	No place indeed should murder sanctuarize;<br>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.<br>Hamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.<br>We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>And set a double varnish on the fame<br>The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,<br>together<br>And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,<br>Most generous, and free from all contriving,<br>Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,<br>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice<br>Requite him for your father.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3347	3364	18	122	Let’s further think of this,<br>Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br>May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,<br>And that our drift look through our bad<br>performance,<br>’Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project<br>Should have a back or second that might hold<br>If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.<br>We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings—<br>I ha ’t!<br>When in your motion you are hot and dry<br>(As make your bouts more violent to that end)<br>And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared<br>him<br>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,<br>If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,<br>Our purpose may hold there.—But stay, what<br>noise?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	4	7	3396	3399	4	25	Let’s follow, Gertrude.<br>How much I had to do to calm his rage!<br>Now fear I this will give it start again.<br>Therefore, let’s follow.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	1	3677	3677	1	3	Pluck them asunder.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	1	3687	3687	1	5	O, he is mad, Laertes!
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	1	3711	3718	8	58	I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.<br>Strengthen your patience in our last<br>night’s speech.<br>We’ll put the matter to the present push.—<br>Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.—<br>This grave shall have a living monument.<br>An hour of quiet thereby shall we see;<br>Till then in patience our proceeding be.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	3957	3957	1	9	Come, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	3995	3996	2	12	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br>You know the wager?
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	3999	4000	2	19	I do not fear it; I have seen you both.<br>But, since he is better, we have therefore odds.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4004	4016	13	104	Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.—<br>If Hamlet give the first or second hit<br>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br>Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.<br>The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,<br>And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br>Richer than that which four successive kings<br>In Denmark’s crown have worn.

CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4024	4026	3	31	Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.<br>Here’s to thy health.<br>Give him the cup.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4030	4030	1	4	Our son shall win.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4035	4035	1	4	Gertrude, do not drink.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4037	4037	1	9	It is the poisoned cup. It is too late.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4041	4041	1	5	I do not think ’t.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4049	4049	1	5	Part them. They are incensed.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4057	4057	1	6	She swoons to see them bleed.
CLAUDIUS-HAM	5	2	4073	4073	1	9	O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
CORNELIUS-HAM	1	2	230	230	1	10	In that and all things will we show our duty.
DOCTOR-HAM	5	1	3632	3641	10	65	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged<br>As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,<br>And, but that great command o’ersways the order,<br>She should in ground unsanctified been lodged<br>Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers<br>Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on<br>her.<br>Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,<br>Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home<br>Of bell and burial.
DOCTOR-HAM	5	1	3643	3646	4	25	No more be done.<br>We should profane the service of the dead<br>To sing a requiem and such rest to her<br>As to peace-parted souls.

If it will please you<br>To show us so much gentry and goodwill<br>As to expend your time with us awhile<br>For the supply and profit of our hope,<br>Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br>As fits a king’s remembrance.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1100	1103	4	28	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.<br>And I beseech you instantly to visit<br>My too much changèd son.—Go, some of you,<br>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1106	1106	1	2	Ay, amen!
GERTRUDE	2	2	1123	1124	2	16	I doubt it is no other but the main—<br>His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1167	1167	1	5	More matter with less art.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1186	1186	1	6	Came this from Hamlet to her?
GERTRUDE	2	2	1226	1226	1	5	It may be, very like.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1239	1239	1	4	So he does indeed.
GERTRUDE	2	2	1247	1248	2	9	But look where sadly the poor wretch comes<br>reading.
GERTRUDE	3	1	1709	1709	1	5	Did he receive you well?
GERTRUDE	3	1	1714	1714	1	7	Did you assay him to any pastime?
GERTRUDE	3	1	1739	1744	6	41	I shall obey you.<br>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish<br>That your good beauties be the happy cause<br>Of Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtues<br>Will bring him to his wonted way again,<br>To both your honors.

GERTRUDE	3	2	2155	2155	1	7	The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
GERTRUDE	3	2	2194	2194	1	4	How fares my lord?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2445	2446	2	11	I’ll warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw,<br>I hear him coming.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2448	2448	1	7	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

GERTRUDE	3	4	2454	2454	1	4	Have you forgot me?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2458	2458	1	10	Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2462	2463	2	11	What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?<br>Help, ho!
GERTRUDE	3	4	2467	2467	1	6	O me, what hast thou done?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2469	2469	1	9	O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
GERTRUDE	3	4	2472	2472	1	4	As kill a king?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2483	2484	2	16	What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue<br>In noise so rude against me?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2497	2498	2	13	Ay me, what act<br>That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2535	2538	4	28	O Hamlet, speak no more!<br>Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul,<br>And there I see such black and grainèd spots<br>As will not leave their tinct.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2543	2545	3	18	O, speak to me no more!<br>These words like daggers enter in my ears.<br>No more, sweet Hamlet!
GERTRUDE	3	4	2552	2552	1	2	No more!
GERTRUDE	3	4	2557	2557	1	3	Alas, he’s mad.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2569	2577	9	69	Alas, how is ’t with you,<br>That you do bend your eye on vacancy<br>And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?<br>Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,<br>And, as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm,<br>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br>Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,<br>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br>Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2585	2585	1	6	To whom do you speak this?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2587	2587	1	9	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2589	2589	1	4	No, nothing but ourselves.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2593	2595	3	16	This is the very coinage of your brain.<br>This bodiless creation ecstasy<br>Is very cunning in.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2613	2613	1	9	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!
GERTRUDE	3	4	2638	2638	1	4	What shall I do?
GERTRUDE	3	4	2655	2657	3	25	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath<br>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br>What thou hast said to me.
GERTRUDE	3	4	2659	2660	2	8	Alack,<br>I had forgot! ’Tis so concluded on.
GERTRUDE	4	1	2680	2681	2	21	Bestow this place on us a little while.<br>Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!
GERTRUDE	4	1	2683	2688	6	43	Mad as the sea and wind when both contend<br>Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,<br>Behind the arras hearing something stir,<br>Whips out his rapier, cries <span class="quote" data-words="4">A rat, a rat,</span><br>And in this brainish apprehension kills<br>The unseen good old man.
GERTRUDE	4	1	2701	2704	4	31	To draw apart the body he hath killed,<br>O’er whom his very madness, like some ore<br>Among a mineral of metals base,<br>Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
GERTRUDE	4	5	2900	2900	1	6	I will not speak with her.
GERTRUDE	4	5	2903	2903	1	4	What would she have?
GERTRUDE	4	5	2920	2924	5	39	Let her come in.<br>To my sick soul (as sin’s true nature is),<br>Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.<br>So full of artless jealousy is guilt,<br>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
GERTRUDE	4	5	2926	2926	1	3	How now, Ophelia?
GERTRUDE	4	5	2931	2931	1	7	Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
GERTRUDE	4	5	2938	2938	1	3	Nay, but Ophelia—
GERTRUDE	4	5	2941	2941	1	5	Alas, look here, my lord.
GERTRUDE	4	5	3003	3003	1	5	Alack, what noise is this?
GERTRUDE	4	5	3018	3019	2	16	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.<br>O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
GERTRUDE	4	5	3028	3028	1	3	Calmly, good Laertes.
GERTRUDE	4	5	3045	3045	1	4	But not by him.
GERTRUDE	4	7	3365	3366	2	15	One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,<br>So fast they follow. Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
GERTRUDE	4	7	3368	3386	19	135	There is a willow grows askant the brook<br>That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.<br>Therewith fantastic garlands did she make<br>Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,<br>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br>But our cold maids do <span class="quote" data-words="3">dead men’s fingers</span> call<br>them.<br>There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds<br>Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,<br>When down her weedy trophies and herself<br>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,<br>And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,<br>Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds,<br>As one incapable of her own distress<br>Or like a creature native and endued<br>Unto that element. But long it could not be<br>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br>Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br>To muddy death.
GERTRUDE	4	7	3388	3388	1	2	Drowned, drowned.
GERTRUDE	5	1	3653	3656	4	32	Sweets to the sweet, farewell!<br>I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;<br>I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,<br>And not have strewed thy grave.
GERTRUDE	5	1	3678	3678	1	2	Hamlet! Hamlet!
GERTRUDE	5	1	3683	3683	1	5	O my son, what theme?
GERTRUDE	5	1	3688	3688	1	6	For love of God, forbear him.
GERTRUDE	5	1	3701	3705	5	32	This is mere madness;<br>And thus awhile the fit will work on him.<br>Anon, as patient as the female dove<br>When that her golden couplets are disclosed,<br>His silence will sit drooping.
GERTRUDE	5	2	4031	4033	3	21	He’s fat and scant of breath.<br>Here, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.<br>The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
GERTRUDE	5	2	4036	4036	1	9	I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
GERTRUDE	5	2	4039	4039	1	6	Come, let me wipe thy face.
GERTRUDE	5	2	4058	4059	2	17	No, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!<br>The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	721	721	1	2	Mark me.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	723	725	3	16	My hour is almost come<br>When I to sulf’rous and tormenting flames<br>Must render up myself.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	727	728	2	13	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br>To what I shall unfold.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	730	730	1	9	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	732	747	16	124	I am thy father’s spirit,<br>Doomed for a certain term to walk the night<br>And for the day confined to fast in fires<br>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br>To tell the secrets of my prison house,<br>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their<br>spheres,<br>Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part,<br>And each particular hair to stand an end,<br>Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.<br>But this eternal blazon must not be<br>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!<br>If thou didst ever thy dear father love—
GHOST-HAM	1	5	749	749	1	7	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	751	752	2	16	Murder most foul, as in the best it is,<br>But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	756	765	10	75	I find thee apt;<br>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.<br>’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark<br>Is by a forgèd process of my death<br>Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,<br>The serpent that did sting thy father’s life<br>Now wears his crown.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	767	816	50	373	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts—<br>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust<br>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.<br>O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!<br>From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>To those of mine.<br>But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,<br>Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br>And prey on garbage.<br>But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.<br>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>My custom always of the afternoon,<br>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>With juice of cursèd hebona in a vial,<br>And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>The leprous distilment, whose effect<br>Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>And with a sudden vigor it doth posset<br>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,<br>And a most instant tetter barked about,<br>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust<br>All my smooth body.<br>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand<br>Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,<br>Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,<br>No reck’ning made, but sent to my account<br>With all my imperfections on my head.<br>O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!<br>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.<br>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.<br>But, howsomever thou pursues this act,<br>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven<br>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge<br>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.<br>The glowworm shows the matin to be near<br>And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.<br>Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	886	886	1	1	Swear.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	894	894	1	1	Swear.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	900	900	1	4	Swear by his sword.
GHOST-HAM	1	5	921	921	1	1	Swear.
GHOST-HAM	3	4	2562	2567	6	38	Do not forget. This visitation<br>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.<br>But look, amazement on thy mother sits.<br>O, step between her and her fighting soul.<br>Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.<br>Speak to her, Hamlet.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3400	3401	2	15	Is she to be buried in Christian burial,<br>when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3402	3404	3	21	I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave<br>straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it<br>Christian burial.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3405	3406	2	12	How can that be, unless she drowned<br>herself in her own defense?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3407	3407	1	4	Why, ’tis found so.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3408	3412	5	42	It must be <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">se offendendo</span>; it cannot be<br>else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself<br>wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three<br>branches—it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she<br>drowned herself wittingly.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3413	3413	1	6	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3414	3420	7	63	Give me leave. Here lies the water;<br>good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to<br>this water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)<br>he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him<br>and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he<br>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his<br>own life.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3421	3421	1	4	But is this law?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3422	3422	1	7	Ay, marry, is ’t—crowner’s ’quest law.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3423	3425	3	23	Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been<br>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’<br>Christian burial.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3426	3431	6	44	Why, there thou sayst. And the more<br>pity that great folk should have count’nance in this<br>world to drown or hang themselves more than<br>their even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no<br>ancient gentlemen but gard’ners, ditchers, and<br>grave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3432	3432	1	4	Was he a gentleman?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3433	3433	1	8	He was the first that ever bore arms.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3434	3434	1	4	Why, he had none.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3435	3439	5	36	What, art a heathen? How dost thou<br>understand the scripture? The scripture says Adam<br>digged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another<br>question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the<br>purpose, confess thyself—
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3440	3440	1	2	Go to!
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3441	3442	2	15	What is he that builds stronger than<br>either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3443	3444	2	9	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a<br>thousand tenants.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3445	3449	5	51	I like thy wit well, in good faith. The<br>gallows does well. But how does it well? It does<br>well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the<br>gallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the<br>gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3450	3450	2	11	<span class="quote" data-words="11">Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,or a carpenter?</span>
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3452	3452	1	6	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3453	3453	1	5	Marry, now I can tell.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3454	3454	1	2	To ’t.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3455	3455	1	4	Mass, I cannot tell.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3456	3461	10	87	Cudgel thy brains no more about it,<br>for your dull ass will not mend his pace with<br>beating. And, when you are asked this question<br>next, say <span class="quote" data-words="2">a grave-maker.</span> The houses he makes<br>lasts till doomsday.

GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3495	3494	4	27	<span class="song" data-words="27">A pickax and a spade, a spade,<br>For and a shrouding sheet,<br>O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>For such a guest is meet.</span>
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3520	3520	3	18	Mine, sir.<span class="song" data-words="15">O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>For such a guest is meet.</span>
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3524	3526	3	24	You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore ’tis<br>not yours. For my part, I do not lie in ’t, yet it is<br>mine.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3530	3531	2	12	’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’twill away again<br>from me to you.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3533	3533	1	4	For no man, sir.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3535	3535	1	3	For none, neither.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3537	3538	2	12	One that was a woman, sir, but, rest<br>her soul, she’s dead.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3546	3548	3	20	Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ’t<br>that day that our last King Hamlet overcame<br>Fortinbras.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3550	3552	3	27	Cannot you tell that? Every fool can<br>tell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet<br>was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3554	3556	3	21	Why, because he was mad. He shall<br>recover his wits there. Or if he do not, ’tis no great<br>matter there.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3558	3559	2	15	’Twill not be seen in him there. There<br>the men are as mad as he.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3561	3561	1	4	Very strangely, they say.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3563	3563	1	6	Faith, e’en with losing his wits.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3565	3566	2	14	Why, here in Denmark. I have been<br>sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3568	3572	5	40	Faith, if he be not rotten before he die<br>(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will<br>scarce hold the laying in), he will last you some<br>eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine<br>year.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3574	3578	5	43	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his<br>trade that he will keep out water a great while; and<br>your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead<br>body. Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earth<br>three-and-twenty years.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3580	3581	2	12	A whoreson mad fellow’s it was.<br>Whose do you think it was?
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3583	3586	4	29	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!<br>He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.<br>This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick’s skull, the<br>King’s jester.
GRAVEDIGGER	5	1	3588	3588	1	2	E’en that.
GRAVEDIGGERS_COMPANION	5	1	3402	3404	3	21	I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave<br>straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it<br>Christian burial.
GRAVEDIGGERS_COMPANION	5	1	3407	3407	1	4	Why, ’tis found so.
GRAVEDIGGERS_COMPANION	5	1	3413	3413	1	6	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—
GRAVEDIGGERS_COMPANION	5	1	3421	3421	1	4	But is this law?

GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1095	1098	4	24	But we both obey,<br>And here give up ourselves in the full bent<br>To lay our service freely at your feet,<br>To be commanded.

GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1304	1304	1	3	My honored lord.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1310	1311	2	16	Happy in that we are not overhappy.<br>On Fortune’s cap, we are not the very button.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1316	1316	1	4	Faith, her privates we.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1325	1325	1	3	Prison, my lord?
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1340	1342	3	19	Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,<br>for the very substance of the ambitious is merely<br>the shadow of a dream.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1350	1350	1	4	We’ll wait upon you.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1363	1363	1	6	What should we say, my lord?
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1379	1379	1	6	My lord, we were sent for.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1445	1446	2	9	O, there has been much throwing<br>about of brains.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1456	1456	1	4	There are the players.
GUILDENSTERN	2	2	1465	1465	1	5	In what, my dear lord?
GUILDENSTERN	3	1	1705	1708	4	29	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,<br>But with a crafty madness keeps aloof<br>When we would bring him on to some confession<br>Of his true state.
GUILDENSTERN	3	1	1711	1711	1	7	But with much forcing of his disposition.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2223	2224	2	9	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word<br>with you.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2226	2226	1	3	The King, sir—
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2228	2229	2	6	Is in his retirement marvelous<br>distempered.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2231	2231	1	5	No, my lord, with choler.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2236	2238	3	17	Good my lord, put your discourse into<br>some frame and start not so wildly from my<br>affair.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2240	2241	2	15	The Queen your mother, in most great<br>affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2243	2247	5	43	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not<br>of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me<br>a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s<br>commandment. If not, your pardon and my return<br>shall be the end of my business.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2279	2280	2	14	O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my<br>love is too unmannerly.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2283	2283	1	4	My lord, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2285	2285	1	4	Believe me, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2287	2287	1	8	I know no touch of it, my lord.
GUILDENSTERN	3	2	2292	2293	2	15	But these cannot I command to any<br>utt’rance of harmony. I have not the skill.
GUILDENSTERN	3	3	2341	2344	4	25	We will ourselves provide.<br>Most holy and religious fear it is<br>To keep those many many bodies safe<br>That live and feed upon your Majesty.

HAMLET	1	2	359	361	3	18	Sir, my good friend. I’ll change that name with you.<br>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—<br>Marcellus?
HAMLET	1	2	363	365	3	20	I am very glad to see you. Good<br>even, sir.—<br>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HAMLET	1	2	367	372	6	48	I would not hear your enemy say so,<br>Nor shall you do my ear that violence<br>To make it truster of your own report<br>Against yourself. I know you are no truant.<br>But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HAMLET	1	2	374	375	2	17	I prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.<br>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.

HAMLET	1	4	686	686	1	9	It will not speak. Then I will follow it.
HAMLET	1	4	688	692	5	40	Why, what should be the fear?<br>I do not set my life at a pin’s fee.<br>And for my soul, what can it do to that,<br>Being a thing immortal as itself?<br>It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.
HAMLET	1	4	703	703	1	9	It waves me still.—Go on, I’ll follow thee.
HAMLET	1	4	705	705	1	4	Hold off your hands.
HAMLET	1	4	707	712	6	45	My fate cries out<br>And makes each petty arture in this body<br>As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.<br>Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.<br>By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!<br>I say, away!—Go on. I’ll follow thee.
HAMLET	1	5	719	720	2	10	Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I’ll go no<br>further.
HAMLET	1	5	722	722	1	2	I will.
HAMLET	1	5	726	726	1	3	Alas, poor ghost!
HAMLET	1	5	729	729	1	6	Speak. I am bound to hear.
HAMLET	1	5	731	731	1	1	What?
HAMLET	1	5	748	748	1	2	O God!
HAMLET	1	5	750	750	1	1	Murder?
HAMLET	1	5	753	755	3	23	Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift<br>As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>May sweep to my revenge.
HAMLET	1	5	766	766	1	6	O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!
HAMLET	1	5	817	837	21	163	O all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?<br>And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,<br>And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?<br>Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat<br>In this distracted globe. Remember thee?<br>Yea, from the table of my memory<br>I’ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,<br>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>That youth and observation copied there,<br>And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!<br>O most pernicious woman!<br>O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!<br>My tables—meet it is I set it down<br>That one may smile and smile and be a villain.<br>At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.<br>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.<br>It is <span class="quote" data-words="4">adieu, adieu, remember me.</span><br>I have sworn ’t.
HAMLET	1	5	841	841	1	3	So be it.
HAMLET	1	5	843	843	1	7	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come!
HAMLET	1	5	846	846	1	2	O, wonderful!
HAMLET	1	5	848	848	1	5	No, you will reveal it.
HAMLET	1	5	851	853	3	15	How say you, then? Would heart of man once think<br>it?<br>But you’ll be secret?
HAMLET	1	5	855	856	2	13	There’s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark<br>But he’s an arrant knave.
HAMLET	1	5	859	865	7	54	Why, right, you are in the right.<br>And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,<br>You, as your business and desire shall point you<br>(For every man hath business and desire,<br>Such as it is), and for my own poor part,<br>I will go pray.
HAMLET	1	5	867	868	2	10	I am sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>Yes, faith, heartily.
HAMLET	1	5	870	876	7	56	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>And much offense, too. Touching this vision here,<br>It is an honest ghost—that let me tell you.<br>For your desire to know what is between us,<br>O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,<br>As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,<br>Give me one poor request.
HAMLET	1	5	878	878	1	8	Never make known what you have seen tonight.
HAMLET	1	5	880	880	1	4	Nay, but swear ’t.
HAMLET	1	5	883	883	1	3	Upon my sword.
HAMLET	1	5	885	885	1	5	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
HAMLET	1	5	887	890	4	22	Ha, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,<br>truepenny?<br>Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.<br>Consent to swear.
HAMLET	1	5	892	893	2	13	Never to speak of this that you have seen,<br>Swear by my sword.
HAMLET	1	5	895	899	5	32	<span class="foreign" data-words="3" data-lang="la">Hic et ubique?</span> Then we’ll shift our ground.<br>Come hither, gentlemen,<br>And lay your hands again upon my sword.<br>Swear by my sword<br>Never to speak of this that you have heard.
HAMLET	1	5	901	902	2	19	Well said, old mole. Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?<br>A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HAMLET	1	5	904	918	17	128	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.<br>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>How strange or odd some’er I bear myself<br>(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>To put an antic disposition on)<br>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br>With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,<br>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>As <span class="quote" data-words="4">Well, well, we know,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="6">We could an if wewould,</span><br>Or <span class="quote" data-words="5">If we list to speak,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="6">There be an if theymight,</span><br>Or such ambiguous giving-out, to note<br>That you know aught of me—this do swear,<br>So grace and mercy at your most need help you.
HAMLET	1	5	922	930	9	77	Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit.—So, gentlemen,<br>With all my love I do commend me to you,<br>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>May do t’ express his love and friending to you,<br>God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,<br>And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>The time is out of joint. O cursèd spite<br>That ever I was born to set it right!<br>Nay, come, let’s go together.
HAMLET	2	2	1252	1252	1	2	Well, God-a-mercy.
HAMLET	2	2	1254	1254	1	6	Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
HAMLET	2	2	1256	1256	1	9	Then I would you were so honest a man.
HAMLET	2	2	1258	1259	2	19	Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to<br>be one man picked out of ten thousand.
HAMLET	2	2	1261	1263	3	19	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead<br>dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a<br>daughter?
HAMLET	2	2	1265	1267	3	21	Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a<br>blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,<br>friend, look to ’t.
HAMLET	2	2	1274	1274	1	3	Words, words, words.
HAMLET	2	2	1276	1276	1	2	Between who?
HAMLET	2	2	1278	1286	9	80	Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here<br>that old men have gray beards, that their faces are<br>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and<br>plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of<br>wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,<br>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I<br>hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for<br>yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,<br>you could go backward.
HAMLET	2	2	1289	1289	1	3	Into my grave?
HAMLET	2	2	1297	1299	3	23	You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I<br>will more willingly part withal—except my life,<br>except my life, except my life.
HAMLET	2	2	1301	1301	1	4	These tedious old fools.
HAMLET	2	2	1306	1308	3	16	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br>Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do<br>you both?
HAMLET	2	2	1312	1312	1	6	Nor the soles of her shoe?
HAMLET	2	2	1314	1315	2	13	Then you live about her waist, or in the<br>middle of her favors?
HAMLET	2	2	1317	1318	2	15	In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!<br>She is a strumpet. What news?
HAMLET	2	2	1321	1324	4	35	Then is doomsday near. But your news is not<br>true. Let me question more in particular. What<br>have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of<br>Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
HAMLET	2	2	1326	1326	1	3	Denmark’s a prison.
HAMLET	2	2	1328	1330	3	18	A goodly one, in which there are many confines,<br>wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’<br>th’ worst.
HAMLET	2	2	1332	1334	3	25	Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is<br>nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it<br>so. To me, it is a prison.
HAMLET	2	2	1337	1339	3	25	O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and<br>count myself a king of infinite space, were it not<br>that I have bad dreams.
HAMLET	2	2	1343	1343	1	7	A dream itself is but a shadow.
HAMLET	2	2	1346	1349	4	26	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs<br>and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows.<br>Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot<br>reason.
HAMLET	2	2	1351	1355	5	40	No such matter. I will not sort you with the<br>rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an<br>honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But<br>in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at<br>Elsinore?
HAMLET	2	2	1357	1362	6	50	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;<br>but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks<br>are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?<br>Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?<br>Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,<br>speak.
HAMLET	2	2	1364	1368	5	39	Anything but to th’ purpose. You were sent<br>for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks<br>which your modesties have not craft enough to<br>color. I know the good king and queen have sent for<br>you.
HAMLET	2	2	1370	1375	6	54	That you must teach me. But let me conjure<br>you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy<br>of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved<br>love, and by what more dear a better<br>proposer can charge you withal: be even and direct<br>with me whether you were sent for or no.
HAMLET	2	2	1377	1378	2	15	Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If<br>you love me, hold not off.
HAMLET	2	2	1380	1398	19	167	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation<br>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the<br>King and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but<br>wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all<br>custom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily<br>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the<br>Earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most<br>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging<br>firmament, this majestical roof, fretted<br>with golden fire—why, it appeareth nothing to me<br>but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.<br>What a piece of work is a man, how noble in<br>reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving<br>how express and admirable; in action how like<br>an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the<br>beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and<br>yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man<br>delights not me, no, nor women neither, though by<br>your smiling you seem to say so.
HAMLET	2	2	1401	1401	2	12	Why did you laugh, then, when I said <span class="quote" data-words="4">mandelights not me</span>?
HAMLET	2	2	1407	1414	8	72	He that plays the king shall be welcome—his<br>Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous<br>knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall<br>not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his<br>part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh<br>whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady<br>shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall<br>halt for ’t. What players are they?
HAMLET	2	2	1417	1418	2	16	How chances it they travel? Their residence,<br>both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
HAMLET	2	2	1421	1422	2	18	Do they hold the same estimation they did<br>when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
HAMLET	2	2	1424	1424	1	7	How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
HAMLET	2	2	1432	1438	7	59	What, are they children? Who maintains ’em?<br>How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality<br>no longer than they can sing? Will they not say<br>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common<br>players (as it is most like, if their means are<br>no better), their writers do them wrong to make<br>them exclaim against their own succession?
HAMLET	2	2	1444	1444	1	3	Is ’t possible?
HAMLET	2	2	1447	1447	1	6	Do the boys carry it away?
HAMLET	2	2	1450	1455	6	53	It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of<br>Denmark, and those that would make mouths at<br>him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,<br>a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.<br>’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,<br>if philosophy could find it out.
HAMLET	2	2	1457	1464	8	57	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.<br>Your hands, come then. Th’ appurtenance of welcome<br>is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply<br>with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,<br>which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should<br>more appear like entertainment than yours. You are<br>welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are<br>deceived.
HAMLET	2	2	1466	1467	2	17	I am but mad north-north-west. When the<br>wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
HAMLET	2	2	1469	1471	3	25	Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at<br>each ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is<br>not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
HAMLET	2	2	1474	1476	3	23	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the<br>players; mark it.—You say right, sir, a Monday<br>morning, ’twas then indeed.
HAMLET	2	2	1478	1479	2	15	My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius<br>was an actor in Rome—
HAMLET	2	2	1481	1481	1	2	Buzz, buzz.
HAMLET	2	2	1483	1483	1	7	Then came each actor on his ass.
HAMLET	2	2	1491	1492	2	10	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure<br>hadst thou!
HAMLET	2	2	1494	1494	3	13	Why,<span class="poem" data-words="12">One fair daughter, and no more,<br>The which he lovèd passing well.</span>
HAMLET	2	2	1498	1498	1	8	Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?
HAMLET	2	2	1501	1501	1	4	Nay, that follows not.
HAMLET	2	2	1503	1518	18	153	Why,<span class="poem" data-words="5">As by lot, God wot</span><br>and then, you know,<span class="poem" data-words="9">It came to pass, as most like it was—</span><br>the first row of the pious chanson will show you<br>more, for look where my abridgment comes.<br>You are welcome, masters; welcome all.—I am glad<br>to see thee well.—Welcome, good friends.—O my<br>old friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee<br>last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark?—What,<br>my young lady and mistress! By ’r Lady, your ladyship<br>is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by<br>the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a<br>piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the<br>ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ’t<br>like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll<br>have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your<br>quality. Come, a passionate speech.
HAMLET	2	2	1522	1540	33	266	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it<br>was never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for<br>the play, I remember, pleased not the million:<br>’twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I<br>received it, and others whose judgments in such<br>matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,<br>well digested in the scenes, set down with as much<br>modesty as cunning. I remember one said there<br>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter<br>savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict<br>the author of affection, but called it an honest<br>method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,<br>more handsome than fine. One speech in ’t I<br>chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and<br>thereabout of it especially when he speaks of<br>Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at<br>this line—let me see, let me see:<span class="verse" data-words="7">The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—</span><br>’tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:<span class="verse" data-words="93">The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br>When he lay couchèd in th’ ominous horse,<br>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared<br>With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,<br>Now is he total gules, horridly tricked<br>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br>That lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light<br>To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,<br>And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore,<br>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br>Old grandsire Priam seeks.</span><br>So, proceed you.
HAMLET	2	2	1588	1590	3	28	It shall to the barber’s with your beard.—<br>Prithee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or<br>he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.
HAMLET	2	2	1592	1592	1	3	<span class="quote" data-words="3">The moblèd queen</span>?
HAMLET	2	2	1611	1616	6	58	’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of<br>this soon.—Good my lord, will you see the players<br>well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,<br>for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the<br>time. After your death you were better have a bad<br>epitaph than their ill report while you live.
HAMLET	2	2	1619	1623	5	38	God’s bodykins, man, much better! Use every<br>man after his desert and who shall ’scape<br>whipping? Use them after your own honor and<br>dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in<br>your bounty. Take them in.
HAMLET	2	2	1625	1628	4	32	Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play<br>tomorrow.<br>Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can<br>you play The Murder of Gonzago?
HAMLET	2	2	1630	1633	4	31	We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night. You could, for a<br>need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen<br>lines, which I would set down and insert in ’t,<br>could you not?
HAMLET	2	2	1635	1637	3	27	Very well. Follow that lord—and look you<br>mock him not. My good friends,<br>I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.
HAMLET	2	2	1639	1698	60	466	Ay, so, good-bye to you.<br>Now I am alone.<br>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>That from her working all his visage wanned,<br>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,<br>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>With forms to his conceit—and all for nothing!<br>For Hecuba!<br>What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>That he should weep for her? What would he do<br>Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>Make mad the guilty and appall the free,<br>Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed<br>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak<br>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>And can say nothing—no, not for a king<br>Upon whose property and most dear life<br>A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>Who calls me <span class="quote" data-words="1">villain</span>? breaks my pate across?<br>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?<br>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ th’ throat<br>As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?<br>Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be<br>But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall<br>To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>I should have fatted all the region kites<br>With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!<br>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless<br>villain!<br>O vengeance!<br>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>That I, the son of a dear father murdered,<br>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words<br>And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br>A stallion! Fie upon ’t! Foh!<br>About, my brains!—Hum, I have heard<br>That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br>Have, by the very cunning of the scene,<br>Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>They have proclaimed their malefactions;<br>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players<br>Play something like the murder of my father<br>Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;<br>I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,<br>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>May be a devil, and the devil hath power<br>T’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,<br>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds<br>More relative than this. The play’s the thing<br>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.
HAMLET	3	1	1762	1796	35	276	To be or not to be—that is the question:<br>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—<br>No more—and by a sleep to say we end<br>The heartache and the thousand natural shocks<br>That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation<br>Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep—<br>To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,<br>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>Must give us pause. There’s the respect<br>That makes calamity of so long life.<br>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,<br>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,<br>The insolence of office, and the spurns<br>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,<br>When he himself might his quietus make<br>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>But that the dread of something after death,<br>The undiscovered country from whose bourn<br>No traveler returns, puzzles the will<br>And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br>And thus the native hue of resolution<br>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,<br>And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>With this regard their currents turn awry<br>And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,<br>The fair Ophelia.—Nymph, in thy orisons<br>Be all my sins remembered.
HAMLET	3	1	1799	1799	1	5	I humbly thank you, well.
HAMLET	3	1	1803	1803	1	8	No, not I. I never gave you aught.
HAMLET	3	1	1811	1811	1	5	Ha, ha, are you honest?
HAMLET	3	1	1813	1813	1	3	Are you fair?
HAMLET	3	1	1815	1816	2	16	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty<br>should admit no discourse to your beauty.
HAMLET	3	1	1819	1823	5	46	Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner<br>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than<br>the force of honesty can translate beauty into his<br>likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now<br>the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
HAMLET	3	1	1825	1827	3	24	You should not have believed me, for virtue<br>cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall<br>relish of it. I loved you not.
HAMLET	3	1	1829	1839	11	98	Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be<br>a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,<br>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it<br>were better my mother had not borne me: I am<br>very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses<br>at my beck than I have thoughts to put them<br>in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act<br>them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling<br>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves<br>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.<br>Where’s your father?
HAMLET	3	1	1841	1842	2	20	Let the doors be shut upon him that he may<br>play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house. Farewell.
HAMLET	3	1	1844	1850	7	62	If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague<br>for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as<br>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a<br>nunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,<br>marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what<br>monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and<br>quickly too. Farewell.
HAMLET	3	1	1852	1860	9	78	I have heard of your paintings too, well<br>enough. God hath given you one face, and you<br>make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and<br>you lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and make<br>your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no<br>more on ’t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have<br>no more marriage. Those that are married already,<br>all but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.<br>To a nunnery, go.
HAMLET	3	2	1902	1916	15	139	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced<br>it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth<br>it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the<br>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air<br>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;<br>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,<br>whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and<br>beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,<br>it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,<br>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very<br>rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the<br>most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable<br>dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow<br>whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods<br>Herod. Pray you, avoid it.
HAMLET	3	2	1918	1938	21	186	Be not too tame neither, but let your own<br>discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the<br>word, the word to the action, with this special<br>observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of<br>nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose<br>of playing, whose end, both at the first and<br>now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to<br>nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her<br>own image, and the very age and body of the time<br>his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come<br>tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,<br>cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure<br>of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh<br>a whole theater of others. O, there be players that I<br>have seen play and heard others praise (and that<br>highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither<br>having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of<br>Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and<br>bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s<br>journeymen had made men, and not made them<br>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
HAMLET	3	2	1941	1950	10	92	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play<br>your clowns speak no more than is set down for<br>them, for there be of them that will themselves<br>laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators<br>to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary<br>question of the play be then to be considered.<br>That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition<br>in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.<br>How now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of<br>work?
HAMLET	3	2	1952	1953	2	14	Bid the players make haste.<br>Will you two help to hasten them?
HAMLET	3	2	1955	1955	1	3	What ho, Horatio!
HAMLET	3	2	1957	1958	2	14	Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man<br>As e’er my conversation coped withal.
HAMLET	3	2	1960	1993	34	261	Nay, do not think I flatter,<br>For what advancement may I hope from thee<br>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits<br>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be<br>flattered?<br>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp<br>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee<br>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?<br>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice<br>And could of men distinguish, her election<br>Hath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been<br>As one in suffering all that suffers nothing,<br>A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards<br>Hast ta’en with equal thanks; and blessed are those<br>Whose blood and judgment are so well<br>commeddled<br>That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger<br>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man<br>That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him<br>In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,<br>As I do thee.—Something too much of this.—<br>There is a play tonight before the King.<br>One scene of it comes near the circumstance<br>Which I have told thee of my father’s death.<br>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,<br>Even with the very comment of thy soul<br>Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt<br>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,<br>It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,<br>And my imaginations are as foul<br>As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note,<br>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,<br>And, after, we will both our judgments join<br>In censure of his seeming.
HAMLET	3	2	1997	1998	2	14	They are coming to the play. I must be idle.<br>Get you a place.
HAMLET	3	2	2000	2002	3	17	Excellent, i’ faith, of the chameleon’s dish. I<br>eat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed<br>capons so.
HAMLET	3	2	2005	2006	2	16	No, nor mine now. My lord, you<br>played once i’ th’ university, you say?
HAMLET	3	2	2009	2009	1	4	What did you enact?
HAMLET	3	2	2012	2013	2	18	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a<br>calf there.—Be the players ready?
HAMLET	3	2	2017	2018	2	7	No, good mother. Here’s metal more<br>attractive.
HAMLET	3	2	2020	2020	1	7	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
HAMLET	3	2	2022	2022	1	7	I mean, my head upon your lap?
HAMLET	3	2	2024	2024	1	7	Do you think I meant country matters?
HAMLET	3	2	2026	2027	2	9	That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’<br>legs.
HAMLET	3	2	2029	2029	1	1	Nothing.
HAMLET	3	2	2031	2031	1	2	Who, I?
HAMLET	3	2	2033	2036	4	29	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a<br>man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully<br>my mother looks, and my father died within ’s two<br>hours.
HAMLET	3	2	2038	2044	8	71	So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,<br>for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two<br>months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s<br>hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half<br>a year. But, by ’r Lady, he must build churches, then,<br>or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the<br>hobby-horse, whose epitaph is <span class="quote" data-words="8">For oh, for oh, thehobby-horse is forgot.</span>
HAMLET	3	2	2059	2060	2	8	Marry, this is miching mallecho. It means<br>mischief.
HAMLET	3	2	2063	2064	2	14	We shall know by this fellow. The players<br>cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.
HAMLET	3	2	2066	2068	3	24	Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be<br>not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you<br>what it means.
HAMLET	3	2	2074	2074	1	10	Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?
HAMLET	3	2	2076	2076	1	3	As woman’s love.
HAMLET	3	2	2105	2105	1	2	That’s wormwood!
HAMLET	3	2	2148	2148	1	6	If she should break it now!
HAMLET	3	2	2154	2154	1	6	Madam, how like you this play?
HAMLET	3	2	2156	2156	1	6	O, but she’ll keep her word.
HAMLET	3	2	2159	2160	2	14	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No<br>offense i’ th’ world.
HAMLET	3	2	2162	2169	8	69	The Mousetrap. Marry, how? Tropically.<br>This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.<br>Gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife Baptista. You<br>shall see anon. ’Tis a knavish piece of work, but<br>what of that? Your Majesty and we that have free<br>souls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince;<br>our withers are unwrung.<br>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
HAMLET	3	2	2171	2172	2	15	I could interpret between you and your love,<br>if I could see the puppets dallying.
HAMLET	3	2	2174	2175	2	11	It would cost you a groaning to take off mine<br>edge.
HAMLET	3	2	2177	2180	4	22	So you mis-take your husbands.—Begin,<br>murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces and<br>begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for<br>revenge.
HAMLET	3	2	2188	2191	4	35	He poisons him i’ th’ garden for his estate. His<br>name’s Gonzago. The story is extant and written in<br>very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the<br>murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.
HAMLET	3	2	2193	2193	1	5	What, frighted with false fire?
HAMLET	3	2	2198	2201	8	60	<span class="poem" data-words="24">Why, let the strucken deer go weep,<br>The hart ungallèd play.<br>For some must watch, while some must sleep:<br>Thus runs the world away.</span>Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers (if the<br>rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me) with two<br>Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a<br>fellowship in a cry of players?
HAMLET	3	2	2207	2207	5	26	A whole one, I.<span class="poem" data-words="22">For thou dost know, O Damon dear,<br>This realm dismantled was<br>Of Jove himself, and now reigns here<br>A very very—pajock.</span>
HAMLET	3	2	2213	2214	2	14	O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for<br>a thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HAMLET	3	2	2216	2216	1	6	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HAMLET	3	2	2218	2220	5	27	Ah ha! Come, some music! Come, the<br>recorders!<span class="poem" data-words="16">For if the King like not the comedy,<br>Why, then, belike he likes it not, perdy.</span><br>Come, some music!
HAMLET	3	2	2225	2225	1	4	Sir, a whole history.
HAMLET	3	2	2227	2227	1	5	Ay, sir, what of him?
HAMLET	3	2	2230	2230	1	3	With drink, sir?
HAMLET	3	2	2232	2235	4	29	Your wisdom should show itself more richer<br>to signify this to the doctor, for for me to put him to<br>his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more<br>choler.
HAMLET	3	2	2239	2239	1	5	I am tame, sir. Pronounce.
HAMLET	3	2	2242	2242	1	3	You are welcome.
HAMLET	3	2	2248	2248	1	3	Sir, I cannot.
HAMLET	3	2	2250	2254	5	37	Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s<br>diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you<br>shall command—or, rather, as you say, my mother.<br>Therefore no more but to the matter. My mother,<br>you say—
HAMLET	3	2	2257	2259	3	22	O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!<br>But is there no sequel at the heels of this<br>mother’s admiration? Impart.
HAMLET	3	2	2262	2263	2	16	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.<br>Have you any further trade with us?
HAMLET	3	2	2265	2265	1	8	And do still, by these pickers and stealers.
HAMLET	3	2	2269	2269	1	4	Sir, I lack advancement.
HAMLET	3	2	2273	2278	6	56	Ay, sir, but <span class="quote" data-words="4">While the grass grows</span>—the<br>proverb is something musty.<br>O, the recorders! Let me see one.<br>To withdraw<br>with you: why do you go about to recover the wind<br>of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
HAMLET	3	2	2281	2282	2	12	I do not well understand that. Will you play<br>upon this pipe?
HAMLET	3	2	2284	2284	1	3	I pray you.
HAMLET	3	2	2286	2286	1	4	I do beseech you.
HAMLET	3	2	2288	2291	4	33	It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages<br>with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with<br>your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent<br>music. Look you, these are the stops.
HAMLET	3	2	2294	2304	11	100	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing<br>you make of me! You would play upon me, you<br>would seem to know my stops, you would pluck<br>out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me<br>from my lowest note to the top of my compass;<br>and there is much music, excellent voice, in this<br>little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood,<br>do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?<br>Call me what instrument you will, though you can<br>fret me, you cannot play upon me.<br>God bless you, sir.
HAMLET	3	2	2307	2308	2	12	Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in<br>shape of a camel?
HAMLET	3	2	2310	2310	1	6	Methinks it is like a weasel.
HAMLET	3	2	2312	2312	1	4	Or like a whale.
HAMLET	3	2	2314	2316	3	26	Then I will come to my mother by and by.<br>They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will<br>come by and by.
HAMLET	3	2	2318	2333	16	113	<span class="quote" data-words="3">By and by</span> is easily said. Leave me,<br>friends.<br>’Tis now the very witching time of night,<br>When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes<br>out<br>Contagion to this world.

Soft, now to my mother.<br>O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever<br>The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.<br>Let me be cruel, not unnatural.<br>I will speak daggers to her, but use none.<br>My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:<br>How in my words somever she be shent,<br>To give them seals never, my soul, consent.
HAMLET	3	3	2410	2434	25	204	Now might I do it pat, now he is a-praying,<br>And now I’ll do ’t.<br>And so he goes to heaven,<br>And so am I revenged. That would be scanned:<br>A villain kills my father, and for that,<br>I, his sole son, do this same villain send<br>To heaven.<br>Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.<br>He took my father grossly, full of bread,<br>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;<br>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.<br>But in our circumstance and course of thought<br>’Tis heavy with him.

My mother stays.<br>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
HAMLET	3	4	2444	2444	1	3	Mother, mother, mother!
HAMLET	3	4	2447	2447	1	5	Now, mother, what’s the matter?
HAMLET	3	4	2449	2449	1	7	Mother, you have my father much offended.
HAMLET	3	4	2451	2451	1	8	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
HAMLET	3	4	2453	2453	1	4	What’s the matter now?
HAMLET	3	4	2455	2457	3	24	No, by the rood, not so.<br>You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,<br>And (would it were not so) you are my mother.
HAMLET	3	4	2459	2461	3	29	Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.<br>You go not till I set you up a glass<br>Where you may see the inmost part of you.
HAMLET	3	4	2465	2465	1	9	How now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.
HAMLET	3	4	2468	2468	1	8	Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
HAMLET	3	4	2470	2471	2	17	A bloody deed—almost as bad, good mother,<br>As kill a king and marry with his brother.
HAMLET	3	4	2473	2482	10	82	Ay, lady, it was my word.<br>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.<br>I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.<br>Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.<br>Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit<br>you down,<br>And let me wring your heart; for so I shall<br>If it be made of penetrable stuff,<br>If damnèd custom have not brazed it so<br>That it be proof and bulwark against sense.
HAMLET	3	4	2485	2496	12	83	Such an act<br>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,<br>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose<br>From the fair forehead of an innocent love<br>And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows<br>As false as dicers’ oaths—O, such a deed<br>As from the body of contraction plucks<br>The very soul, and sweet religion makes<br>A rhapsody of words! Heaven’s face does glow<br>O’er this solidity and compound mass<br>With heated visage, as against the doom,<br>Is thought-sick at the act.
HAMLET	3	4	2499	2534	36	277	Look here upon this picture and on this,<br>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br>See what a grace was seated on this brow,<br>Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,<br>An eye like Mars’ to threaten and command,<br>A station like the herald Mercury<br>New-lighted on a <span class="" data-words="0">heaven</span>-kissing hill,<br>A combination and a form indeed<br>Where every god did seem to set his seal<br>To give the world assurance of a man.<br>This was your husband.

Ha! Have you eyes?<br>You cannot call it love, for at your age<br>The heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble<br>And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment<br>Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,<br>Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense<br>Is apoplexed; for madness would not err,<br>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled,<br>But it reserved some quantity of choice<br>To serve in such a difference. What devil was ’t<br>That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?<br>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,<br>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br>Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?<br>Rebellious hell,<br>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,<br>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax<br>And melt in her own fire.

HAMLET	3	4	2539	2542	4	23	Nay, but to live<br>In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed,<br>Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love<br>Over the nasty sty!
HAMLET	3	4	2546	2551	6	44	A murderer and a villain,<br>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe<br>Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings,<br>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,<br>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole<br>And put it in his pocket—
HAMLET	3	4	2553	2556	4	25	A king of shreds and patches—<br>Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,<br>You heavenly guards!—What would your gracious<br>figure?
HAMLET	3	4	2558	2561	4	27	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,<br>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by<br>Th’ important acting of your dread command?<br>O, say!
HAMLET	3	4	2568	2568	1	6	How is it with you, lady?
HAMLET	3	4	2578	2584	7	54	On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.<br>His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,<br>Would make them capable. Do not<br>look upon me,<br>Lest with this piteous action you convert<br>My stern effects. Then what I have to do<br>Will want true color—tears perchance for blood.
HAMLET	3	4	2586	2586	1	5	Do you see nothing there?
HAMLET	3	4	2588	2588	1	5	Nor did you nothing hear?
HAMLET	3	4	2590	2592	3	27	Why, look you there, look how it steals away!<br>My father, in his habit as he lived!<br>Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
HAMLET	3	4	2596	2612	17	131	Ecstasy?<br>My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time<br>And makes as healthful music. It is not madness<br>That I have uttered. Bring me to the test,<br>And I the matter will reword, which madness<br>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br>Lay not that flattering unction to your soul<br>That not your trespass but my madness speaks.<br>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br>Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,<br>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,<br>Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,<br>And do not spread the compost on the weeds<br>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,<br>For, in the fatness of these pursy times,<br>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,<br>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
HAMLET	3	4	2614	2637	24	196	O, throw away the worser part of it,<br>And live the purer with the other half!<br>Good night. But go not to my uncle’s bed.<br>Assume a virtue if you have it not.<br>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,<br>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,<br>That to the use of actions fair and good<br>He likewise gives a frock or livery<br>That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,<br>And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br>To the next abstinence, the next more easy;<br>For use almost can change the stamp of nature<br>And either  the devil or throw him out<br>With wondrous potency.

HAMLET	4	2	2723	2723	1	2	Safely stowed.
HAMLET	4	2	2725	2726	2	12	But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?<br>O, here they come.
HAMLET	4	2	2728	2728	1	7	Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
HAMLET	4	2	2731	2731	1	4	Do not believe it.
HAMLET	4	2	2733	2735	3	28	That I can keep your counsel and not mine<br>own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what<br>replication should be made by the son of a king?
HAMLET	4	2	2737	2743	7	62	Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance,<br>his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the<br>King best service in the end. He keeps them like an<br>ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,<br>to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have<br>gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you<br>shall be dry again.
HAMLET	4	2	2745	2746	2	13	I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a<br>foolish ear.
HAMLET	4	2	2749	2750	2	19	The body is with the King, but the King is not<br>with the body. The King is a thing—
HAMLET	4	2	2752	2753	2	11	Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and<br>all after!
HAMLET	4	3	2773	2773	1	2	At supper.
HAMLET	4	3	2775	2781	7	61	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A<br>certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at<br>him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We<br>fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves<br>for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is<br>but variable service—two dishes but to one table.<br>That’s the end.
HAMLET	4	3	2783	2785	3	24	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat<br>of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that<br>worm.
HAMLET	4	3	2787	2788	2	18	Nothing but to show you how a king may go a<br>progress through the guts of a beggar.
HAMLET	4	3	2790	2794	5	43	In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger<br>find him not there, seek him i’ th’ other<br>place yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not<br>within this month, you shall nose him as you go up<br>the stairs into the lobby.
HAMLET	4	3	2796	2796	1	6	He will stay till you come.
HAMLET	4	3	2805	2805	1	2	For England?
HAMLET	4	3	2807	2807	1	1	Good.
HAMLET	4	3	2809	2811	3	14	I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for<br>England.<br>Farewell, dear mother.
HAMLET	4	3	2813	2815	3	22	My mother. Father and mother is man and wife,<br>Man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.—<br>Come, for England.
HAMLET	4	4	2840	2840	1	6	Good sir, whose powers are these?
HAMLET	4	4	2842	2842	1	6	How purposed, sir, I pray you?
HAMLET	4	4	2844	2844	1	4	Who commands them, sir?
HAMLET	4	4	2846	2847	2	12	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,<br>Or for some frontier?
HAMLET	4	4	2854	2854	1	8	Why, then, the Polack never will defend it.
HAMLET	4	4	2856	2860	5	41	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats<br>Will not debate the question of this straw.<br>This is th’ impostume of much wealth and peace,<br>That inward breaks and shows no cause without<br>Why the man dies.—I humbly thank you, sir.
HAMLET	4	4	2863	2899	37	292	I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.<br>How all occasions do inform against me<br>And spur my dull revenge. What is a man<br>If his chief good and market of his time<br>Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.<br>Sure He that made us with such large discourse,<br>Looking before and after, gave us not<br>That capability and godlike reason<br>To fust in us unused. Now whether it be<br>Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple<br>Of thinking too precisely on th’ event<br>(A thought which, quartered, hath but one part<br>wisdom<br>And ever three parts coward), I do not know<br>Why yet I live to say <span class="quote" data-words="4">This thing’s to do,</span><br>Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means<br>To do ’t. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:<br>Witness this army of such mass and charge,<br>Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br>Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed<br>Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br>Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,<br>Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great<br>Is not to stir without great argument,<br>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br>When honor’s at the stake. How stand I, then,<br>That have a father killed, a mother stained,<br>Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see<br>The imminent death of twenty thousand men<br>That for a fantasy and trick of fame<br>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br>Which is not tomb enough and continent<br>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth<br>My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth!
HAMLET	5	1	3466	3467	2	12	Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He<br>sings in grave-making.
HAMLET	5	1	3470	3471	2	12	’Tis e’en so. The hand of little employment<br>hath the daintier sense.
HAMLET	5	1	3476	3481	6	50	That skull had a tongue in it and could sing<br>once. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if<br>’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!<br>This might be the pate of a politician which this ass<br>now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God,<br>might it not?
HAMLET	5	1	3483	3486	5	37	Or of a courtier, which could say <span class="quote" data-words="9">Goodmorrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?</span><br>This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my<br>Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it,<br>might it not?
HAMLET	5	1	3489	3494	6	50	Why, e’en so. And now my Lady Worm’s,<br>chapless and knocked about the mazard with a<br>sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had<br>the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the<br>breeding but to play at loggets with them? Mine<br>ache to think on ’t.
HAMLET	5	1	3499	3513	15	146	There’s another. Why may not that be the<br>skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his<br>quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why<br>does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him<br>about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell<br>him of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might<br>be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,<br>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,<br>his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the<br>recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full<br>of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more<br>of his purchases, and double ones too, than the<br>length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very<br>conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,<br>and must th’ inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HAMLET	5	1	3515	3515	1	6	Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
HAMLET	5	1	3517	3519	3	21	They are sheep and calves which seek out<br>assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.—<br>Whose grave’s this, sirrah?
HAMLET	5	1	3523	3523	1	11	I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in ’t.
HAMLET	5	1	3527	3529	3	25	Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine.<br>’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou<br>liest.
HAMLET	5	1	3532	3532	1	7	What man dost thou dig it for?
HAMLET	5	1	3534	3534	1	3	What woman then?
HAMLET	5	1	3536	3536	1	7	Who is to be buried in ’t?
HAMLET	5	1	3539	3545	7	59	How absolute the knave is! We must speak by<br>the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the<br>Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of<br>it: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the<br>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he<br>galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been<br>grave-maker?
HAMLET	5	1	3549	3549	1	5	How long is that since?
HAMLET	5	1	3553	3553	1	8	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
HAMLET	5	1	3557	3557	1	1	Why?
HAMLET	5	1	3560	3560	1	4	How came he mad?
HAMLET	5	1	3562	3562	1	2	How <span class="quote" data-words="1">strangely</span>?
HAMLET	5	1	3564	3564	1	3	Upon what ground?
HAMLET	5	1	3567	3567	1	12	How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot?
HAMLET	5	1	3573	3573	1	5	Why he more than another?
HAMLET	5	1	3579	3579	1	3	Whose was it?
HAMLET	5	1	3582	3582	1	4	Nay, I know not.
HAMLET	5	1	3587	3587	1	1	This?
HAMLET	5	1	3589	3601	13	122	Let me see. Alas, poor<br>Yorick! I knew him, Horatio—a fellow of infinite<br>jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his<br>back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in<br>my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung<br>those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.<br>Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your<br>songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to<br>set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your<br>own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my<br>lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch<br>thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh<br>at that.—Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
HAMLET	5	1	3603	3604	2	11	Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this<br>fashion i’ th’ earth?
HAMLET	5	1	3606	3606	1	4	And smelt so? Pah!
HAMLET	5	1	3608	3610	3	25	To what base uses we may return, Horatio!<br>Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of<br>Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
HAMLET	5	1	3613	3628	16	152	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,<br>with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as<br>thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander<br>returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth<br>we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he<br>was converted might they not stop a beer barrel?<br>Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,<br>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.<br>O, that that earth which kept the world in awe<br>Should patch a wall t’ expel the winter’s flaw!<br>But soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,<br>The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?<br>And with such maimèd rites? This doth betoken<br>The corse they follow did with desp’rate hand<br>Fordo its own life. ’Twas of some estate.<br>Couch we awhile and mark.
HAMLET	5	1	3630	3630	1	8	That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.
HAMLET	5	1	3652	3652	1	4	What, the fair Ophelia?
HAMLET	5	1	3666	3670	5	30	What is he whose grief<br>Bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow<br>Conjures the wand’ring stars and makes them stand<br>Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,<br>Hamlet the Dane.
HAMLET	5	1	3672	3676	5	38	Thou pray’st not well.<br>I prithee take thy fingers from my throat,<br>For though I am not splenitive and rash,<br>Yet have I in me something dangerous,<br>Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.
HAMLET	5	1	3681	3682	2	16	Why, I will fight with him upon this theme<br>Until my eyelids will no longer wag!
HAMLET	5	1	3684	3686	3	24	I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers<br>Could not with all their quantity of love<br>Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
HAMLET	5	1	3689	3700	12	88	’Swounds, show me what thou ’t do.<br>Woo’t weep, woo’t fight, woo’t fast, woo’t tear<br>thyself,<br>Woo’t drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?<br>I’ll do ’t. Dost thou come here to whine?<br>To outface me with leaping in her grave?<br>Be buried quick with her, and so will I.<br>And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw<br>Millions of acres on us, till our ground,<br>Singeing his pate against the burning zone,<br>Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,<br>I’ll rant as well as thou.
HAMLET	5	1	3706	3710	5	38	Hear you, sir,<br>What is the reason that you use me thus?<br>I loved you ever. But it is no matter.<br>Let Hercules himself do what he may,<br>The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
HAMLET	5	2	3719	3720	2	17	So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.<br>You do remember all the circumstance?
HAMLET	5	2	3722	3730	9	65	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting<br>That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay<br>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—<br>And praised be rashness for it: let us know,<br>Our indiscretion sometime serves us well<br>When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn<br>us<br>There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>Rough-hew them how we will—
HAMLET	5	2	3733	3746	14	99	Up from my cabin,<br>My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark<br>Groped I to find out them; had my desire,<br>Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew<br>To mine own room again, making so bold<br>(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold<br>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,<br>A royal knavery—an exact command,<br>Larded with many several sorts of reasons<br>Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,<br>With—ho!—such bugs and goblins in my life,<br>That on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br>No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,<br>My head should be struck off.
HAMLET	5	2	3748	3749	2	21	Here’s the commission. Read it at more leisure.<br>But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?
HAMLET	5	2	3751	3759	9	70	Being thus benetted round with villainies,<br>Or I could make a prologue to my brains,<br>They had begun the play. I sat me down,<br>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair—<br>I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br>A baseness to write fair, and labored much<br>How to forget that learning; but, sir, now<br>It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know<br>Th’ effect of what I wrote?
HAMLET	5	2	3761	3770	10	70	An earnest conjuration from the King,<br>As England was his faithful tributary,<br>As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br>As peace should still her wheaten garland wear<br>And stand a comma ’tween their amities,<br>And many suchlike ases of great charge,<br>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br>Without debatement further, more or less,<br>He should those bearers put to sudden death,<br>Not shriving time allowed.
HAMLET	5	2	3772	3780	9	62	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br>I had my father’s signet in my purse,<br>Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br>Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,<br>Subscribed it, gave ’t th’ impression, placed it<br>safely,<br>The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br>Thou knowest already.
HAMLET	5	2	3782	3787	6	40	Why, man, they did make love to this employment.<br>They are not near my conscience. Their defeat<br>Does by their own insinuation grow.<br>’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br>Between the pass and fell incensèd points<br>Of mighty opposites.
HAMLET	5	2	3789	3798	10	68	Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon—<br>He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,<br>Popped in between th’ election and my hopes,<br>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br>And with such cozenage—is ’t not perfect<br>conscience<br>To quit him with this arm? And is ’t not to be<br>damned<br>To let this canker of our nature come<br>In further evil?
HAMLET	5	2	3801	3808	8	61	It will be short. The interim’s mine,<br>And a man’s life’s no more than to say <span class="quote" data-words="1">one.</span><br>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br>That to Laertes I forgot myself,<br>For by the image of my cause I see<br>The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.<br>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br>Into a tow’ring passion.
HAMLET	5	2	3812	3813	2	12	I humbly thank you, sir.<br>Dost know this waterfly?
HAMLET	5	2	3815	3819	5	48	Thy state is the more gracious,<br>for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much<br>land, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his<br>crib shall stand at the king’s mess. ’Tis a chough,<br>but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
HAMLET	5	2	3822	3824	3	21	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of<br>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: ’tis for the<br>head.
HAMLET	5	2	3826	3827	2	10	No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is<br>northerly.
HAMLET	5	2	3829	3830	2	12	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for<br>my complexion.
HAMLET	5	2	3835	3835	1	4	I beseech you, remember.
HAMLET	5	2	3843	3851	9	78	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in<br>you, though I know to divide him inventorially<br>would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but<br>yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the<br>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great<br>article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness<br>as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his<br>mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,<br>nothing more.
HAMLET	5	2	3853	3854	2	14	The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the<br>gentleman in our more rawer breath?
HAMLET	5	2	3858	3859	2	7	What imports the nomination of<br>this gentleman?
HAMLET	5	2	3863	3863	1	3	Of him, sir.
HAMLET	5	2	3865	3866	2	19	I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, itwould not much approve me. Well, sir?<br>
HAMLET	5	2	3869	3871	3	23	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare<br>with him in excellence. But to know a man well<br>were to know himself.
HAMLET	5	2	3875	3875	1	3	What’s his weapon?
HAMLET	5	2	3877	3877	1	7	That’s two of his weapons. But, well—
HAMLET	5	2	3885	3885	1	5	What call you the <span class="quote" data-words="1">carriages</span>?
HAMLET	5	2	3889	3895	7	57	The phrase would be more germane to the<br>matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I<br>would it might be <span class="quote" data-words="1">hangers</span> till then. But on. Six<br>Barbary horses against six French swords, their<br>assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—<br>that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this<br>all <span class="quote" data-words="1">impawned,</span> as you call it?
HAMLET	5	2	3901	3901	1	5	How if I answer no?
HAMLET	5	2	3904	3909	6	57	Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his<br>Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let<br>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the<br>King hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.<br>If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd<br>hits.
HAMLET	5	2	3911	3912	2	10	To this effect, sir, after what flourish your<br>nature will.
HAMLET	5	2	3914	3916	3	18	Yours. He does well to commend<br>it himself. There are no tongues else for ’s<br>turn.
HAMLET	5	2	3919	3926	8	72	He did comply, sir, with his dug before he<br>sucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same<br>breed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got<br>the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of<br>encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries<br>them through and through the most fanned<br>and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to<br>their trial, the bubbles are out.
HAMLET	5	2	3932	3935	4	28	I am constant to my purposes. They follow<br>the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is<br>ready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as<br>now.
HAMLET	5	2	3937	3937	1	3	In happy time.
HAMLET	5	2	3940	3940	1	4	She well instructs me.
HAMLET	5	2	3942	3945	4	39	I do not think so. Since he went into France, I<br>have been in continual practice. I shall win at the<br>odds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here<br>about my heart. But it is no matter.
HAMLET	5	2	3947	3948	2	18	It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of<br>gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HAMLET	5	2	3951	3956	6	64	Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a<br>special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be<br>now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be<br>now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The<br>readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves<br>knows, what is ’t to leave betimes? Let be.
HAMLET	5	2	3958	3976	19	140	Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;<br>But pardon ’t as you are a gentleman. This presence<br>knows,<br>And you must needs have heard, how I am punished<br>With a sore distraction. What I have done<br>That might your nature, honor, and exception<br>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br>Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.<br>If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,<br>And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,<br>Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.<br>Who does it, then? His madness. If ’t be so,<br>Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;<br>His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.<br>Sir, in this audience<br>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil<br>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts<br>That I have shot my arrow o’er the house<br>And hurt my brother.
HAMLET	5	2	3986	3988	3	17	I embrace it freely<br>And will this brothers’ wager frankly play.—<br>Give us the foils. Come on.
HAMLET	5	2	3990	3992	3	22	I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance<br>Your skill shall, like a star i’ th’ darkest night,<br>Stick fiery off indeed.
HAMLET	5	2	3994	3994	1	4	No, by this hand.
HAMLET	5	2	3997	3998	2	14	Very well, my lord.<br>Your Grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side.
HAMLET	5	2	4002	4002	1	10	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
HAMLET	5	2	4017	4017	1	3	Come on, sir.
HAMLET	5	2	4019	4019	1	1	One.
HAMLET	5	2	4021	4021	1	1	Judgment!
HAMLET	5	2	4027	4028	2	17	I’ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.<br>Come. Another hit. What say you?
HAMLET	5	2	4034	4034	1	2	Good madam.
HAMLET	5	2	4038	4038	1	9	I dare not drink yet, madam—by and by.
HAMLET	5	2	4043	4045	3	26	Come, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.<br>I pray you pass with your best violence.<br>I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
HAMLET	5	2	4050	4050	1	3	Nay, come again.
HAMLET	5	2	4056	4056	1	4	How does the Queen?
HAMLET	5	2	4060	4061	2	14	O villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.<br>Treachery! Seek it out.
HAMLET	5	2	4070	4071	2	9	The point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy<br>work.
HAMLET	5	2	4074	4076	3	23	Here, thou incestuous, murd’rous, damnèd Dane,<br>Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?<br>Follow my mother.
HAMLET	5	2	4082	4090	9	72	Heaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.—<br>I am dead, Horatio.—Wretched queen, adieu.—<br>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br>That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br>Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,<br>Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you—<br>But let it be.—Horatio, I am dead.<br>Thou livest; report me and my cause aright<br>To the unsatisfied.
HAMLET	5	2	4094	4103	10	72	As thou ’rt a man,<br>Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I’ll ha ’t.<br>O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,<br>Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind<br>me!<br>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br>Absent thee from felicity awhile<br>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain<br>To tell my story.<br>What warlike noise is this?
HAMLET	5	2	4107	4114	8	54	O, I die, Horatio!<br>The potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit.<br>I cannot live to hear the news from England.<br>But I do prophesy th’ election lights<br>On Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.<br>So tell him, with th’ occurrents, more and less,<br>Which have solicited—the rest is silence.<br>O, O, O, O!
HORATIO	1	1	124	152	29	213	A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.<br>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,<br>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,<br>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br>And even the like precurse of feared events,<br>As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>Unto our climatures and countrymen.<br>But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!<br>I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!<br>If thou hast any sound or use of voice,<br>Speak to me.<br>If there be any good thing to be done<br>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>Speak to me.<br>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,<br>Which happily foreknowing may avoid,<br>O, speak!<br>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>Speak of it.<br>Stay and speak!—Stop it, Marcellus.
HORATIO	1	1	154	154	1	6	Do, if it will not stand.
HORATIO	1	1	156	156	1	2	’Tis here.
HORATIO	1	1	16	16	1	4	Friends to this ground.
HORATIO	1	1	163	171	9	68	And then it started like a guilty thing<br>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard<br>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>Awake the god of day, and at his warning,<br>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>To his confine, and of the truth herein<br>This present object made probation.
HORATIO	1	1	180	188	9	77	So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad<br>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.<br>Break we our watch up, and by my advice<br>Let us impart what we have seen tonight<br>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it<br>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
HORATIO	1	1	24	24	1	4	A piece of him.
HORATIO	1	1	26	26	1	7	What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
HORATIO	1	1	35	35	1	5	Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.
HORATIO	1	1	40	41	2	12	Well, sit we down,<br>And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
HORATIO	1	1	51	51	1	9	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
HORATIO	1	1	54	58	5	32	What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,<br>Together with that fair and warlike form<br>In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,<br>speak.
HORATIO	1	1	61	61	1	7	Stay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!
HORATIO	1	1	66	68	3	18	Before my God, I might not this believe<br>Without the sensible and true avouch<br>Of mine own eyes.
HORATIO	1	1	70	75	6	38	As thou art to thyself.<br>Such was the very armor he had on<br>When he the ambitious Norway combated.<br>So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,<br>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>’Tis strange.
HORATIO	1	1	78	80	3	26	In what particular thought to work I know not,<br>But in the gross and scope of mine opinion<br>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
HORATIO	1	1	91	119	29	225	That can I.<br>At least the whisper goes so: our last king,<br>Whose image even but now appeared to us,<br>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,<br>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet<br>(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)<br>Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,<br>Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.<br>Against the which a moiety competent<br>Was gagèd by our king, which had returned<br>To the inheritance of Fortinbras<br>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart<br>And carriage of the article designed,<br>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,<br>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes<br>For food and diet to some enterprise<br>That hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other<br>(As it doth well appear unto our state)<br>But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>So by his father lost. And this, I take it,<br>Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br>Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.
HORATIO	1	2	355	355	1	4	Hail to your Lordship.
HORATIO	1	2	358	358	1	9	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HORATIO	1	2	366	366	1	6	A truant disposition, good my lord.
HORATIO	1	2	373	373	1	9	My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
HORATIO	1	2	376	376	1	7	Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
HORATIO	1	2	382	382	1	3	Where, my lord?
HORATIO	1	2	384	384	1	9	I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
HORATIO	1	2	387	387	1	8	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HORATIO	1	2	389	389	1	6	My lord, the King your father.
HORATIO	1	2	391	394	4	24	Season your admiration for a while<br>With an attent ear, till I may deliver<br>Upon the witness of these gentlemen<br>This marvel to you.
HORATIO	1	2	396	412	17	128	Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,<br>In the dead waste and middle of the night,<br>Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,<br>Armèd at point exactly, cap-à-pie,<br>Appears before them and with solemn march<br>Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked<br>By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes<br>Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled<br>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,<br>And I with them the third night kept the watch,<br>Where, as they had delivered, both in time,<br>Form of the thing (each word made true and good),<br>The apparition comes. I knew your father;<br>These hands are not more like.
HORATIO	1	2	416	422	7	50	My lord, I did,<br>But answer made it none. Yet once methought<br>It lifted up its head and did address<br>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away<br>And vanished from our sight.
HORATIO	1	2	424	426	3	25	As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.<br>And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>To let you know of it.
HORATIO	1	2	429	429	1	4	We do, my lord.
HORATIO	1	2	431	431	1	3	Armed, my lord.
HORATIO	1	2	433	433	1	6	My lord, from head to foot.
HORATIO	1	2	435	435	1	9	O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
HORATIO	1	2	437	437	1	8	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HORATIO	1	2	439	439	1	3	Nay, very pale.
HORATIO	1	2	441	441	1	2	Most constantly.
HORATIO	1	2	443	443	1	6	It would have much amazed you.
HORATIO	1	2	445	446	2	9	While one with moderate haste might tell a<br>hundred.
HORATIO	1	2	448	448	1	5	Not when I saw ’t.
HORATIO	1	2	450	451	2	13	It was as I have seen it in his life,<br>A sable silvered.
HORATIO	1	2	454	454	1	4	I warrant it will.
HORATIO	1	2	465	465	1	5	Our duty to your Honor.
HORATIO	1	4	618	618	1	8	It is a nipping and an eager air.
HORATIO	1	4	620	620	1	6	I think it lacks of twelve.
HORATIO	1	4	622	624	3	34	Indeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season<br>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.<br>What does this mean, my lord?
HORATIO	1	4	630	630	1	4	Is it a custom?
HORATIO	1	4	658	658	1	5	Look, my lord, it comes.
HORATIO	1	4	679	681	3	18	It beckons you to go away with it<br>As if it some impartment did desire<br>To you alone.
HORATIO	1	4	685	685	1	4	No, by no means.
HORATIO	1	4	687	687	1	4	Do not, my lord.
HORATIO	1	4	693	702	10	74	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?<br>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br>That beetles o’er his base into the sea,<br>And there assume some other horrible form<br>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason<br>And draw you into madness? Think of it.<br>The very place puts toys of desperation,<br>Without more motive, into every brain<br>That looks so many fathoms to the sea<br>And hears it roar beneath.
HORATIO	1	4	706	706	1	6	Be ruled. You shall not go.
HORATIO	1	4	713	713	1	5	He waxes desperate with imagination.
HORATIO	1	4	715	715	1	8	Have after. To what issue will this come?
HORATIO	1	4	717	717	1	4	Heaven will direct it.
HORATIO	1	5	838	838	1	4	My lord, my lord!
HORATIO	1	5	840	840	1	3	Heavens secure him!
HORATIO	1	5	845	845	1	4	What news, my lord?
HORATIO	1	5	847	847	1	5	Good my lord, tell it.
HORATIO	1	5	849	849	1	6	Not I, my lord, by heaven.
HORATIO	1	5	854	854	1	5	 Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HORATIO	1	5	857	858	2	14	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave<br>To tell us this.
HORATIO	1	5	866	866	1	9	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HORATIO	1	5	869	869	1	5	There’s no offense, my lord.
HORATIO	1	5	877	877	1	7	What is ’t, my lord? We will.
HORATIO	1	5	879	879	1	5	 My lord, we will not.
HORATIO	1	5	881	881	1	6	In faith, my lord, not I.
HORATIO	1	5	891	891	1	5	Propose the oath, my lord.
HORATIO	1	5	903	903	1	9	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
HORATIO	3	2	1956	1956	1	6	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HORATIO	3	2	1959	1959	1	4	O, my dear lord—
HORATIO	3	2	1994	1996	3	21	Well, my lord.<br>If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing<br>And ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HORATIO	3	2	2206	2206	1	3	Half a share.
HORATIO	3	2	2212	2212	1	4	You might have rhymed.
HORATIO	3	2	2215	2215	1	4	Very well, my lord.
HORATIO	3	2	2217	2217	1	6	I did very well note him.
HORATIO	4	5	2917	2919	3	15	’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may<br>strew<br>Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
HORATIO	4	6	3145	3145	1	8	What are they that would speak with me?
HORATIO	4	6	3148	3150	3	25	Let them come in. I do not<br>know from what part of the world I should be<br>greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
HORATIO	4	6	3152	3152	1	5	Let Him bless thee too.
HORATIO	4	6	3157	3159	22	201	<span class="letter" data-words="174">Horatio, when thou shalt have<br>overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the<br>King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days<br>old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave<br>us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on<br>a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.<br>On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone<br>became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like<br>thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to<br>do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters<br>I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed<br>as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in<br>thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too<br>light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows<br>will bring thee where I am.

HORATIO	5	1	3468	3469	2	10	Custom hath made it in him a property of<br>easiness.
HORATIO	5	1	3482	3482	1	4	It might, my lord.
HORATIO	5	1	3488	3488	1	3	Ay, my lord.
HORATIO	5	1	3514	3514	1	6	Not a jot more, my lord.
HORATIO	5	1	3516	3516	1	8	Ay, my lord, and of calves’ skins too.
HORATIO	5	1	3602	3602	1	4	What’s that, my lord?
HORATIO	5	1	3605	3605	1	2	E’en so.
HORATIO	5	1	3607	3607	1	4	E’en so, my lord.
HORATIO	5	1	3611	3612	2	8	’Twere to consider too curiously to consider<br>so.
HORATIO	5	1	3680	3680	1	5	Good my lord, be quiet.
HORATIO	5	2	3721	3721	1	4	Remember it, my lord!
HORATIO	5	2	3731	3732	2	4	That is most<br>certain.
HORATIO	5	2	3747	3747	1	3	Is ’t possible?
HORATIO	5	2	3750	3750	1	3	I beseech you.
HORATIO	5	2	3760	3760	1	4	Ay, good my lord.
HORATIO	5	2	3771	3771	1	4	How was this sealed?
HORATIO	5	2	3781	3781	1	7	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
HORATIO	5	2	3788	3788	1	6	Why, what a king is this!
HORATIO	5	2	3799	3800	2	17	It must be shortly known to him from England<br>What is the issue of the business there.
HORATIO	5	2	3809	3809	1	4	Peace, who comes here?
HORATIO	5	2	3814	3814	1	4	No, my good lord.
HORATIO	5	2	3856	3857	2	17	Is ’t not possible to understand in another<br>tongue? You will to ’t, sir, really.
HORATIO	5	2	3861	3862	2	13	His purse is empty already; all ’s golden words<br>are spent.
HORATIO	5	2	3886	3887	2	16	I knew you must be edified by the margent<br>ere you had done.
HORATIO	5	2	3917	3918	2	10	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his<br>head.
HORATIO	5	2	3941	3941	1	5	You will lose, my lord.
HORATIO	5	2	3946	3946	1	4	Nay, good my lord—
HORATIO	5	2	3949	3950	2	19	If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will<br>forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
HORATIO	5	2	4052	4052	1	10	They bleed on both sides.—How is it, my lord?
HORATIO	5	2	4091	4093	3	17	Never believe it.<br>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.<br>Here’s yet some liquor left.
HORATIO	5	2	4115	4117	3	26	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,<br>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.<br>Why does the drum come hither?
HORATIO	5	2	4119	4120	2	15	What is it you would see?<br>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
HORATIO	5	2	4131	4146	16	109	Not from his<br>mouth,<br>Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.<br>He never gave commandment for their death.<br>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br>Are here arrived, give order that these bodies<br>High on a stage be placed to the view,<br>And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world<br>How these things came about. So shall you hear<br>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,<br>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,<br>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br>Fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads. All this can I<br>Truly deliver.

LAERTES	1	3	472	475	4	25	My necessaries are embarked. Farewell.<br>And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>And convey is assistant, do not sleep,<br>But let me hear from you.

LAERTES	4	7	3205	3209	5	38	And so have I a noble father lost,<br>A sister driven into desp’rate terms,<br>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br>Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br>For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
LAERTES	4	7	3234	3234	1	4	Know you the hand?
LAERTES	4	7	3238	3241	4	32	I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come.<br>It warms the very sickness in my heart<br>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">Thus didst thou.</span>
LAERTES	4	7	3245	3246	2	12	Ay, my lord,<br>So you will not o’errule me to a peace.
LAERTES	4	7	3255	3257	3	20	My lord, I will be ruled,<br>The rather if you could devise it so<br>That I might be the organ.
LAERTES	4	7	3265	3265	1	6	What part is that, my lord?
LAERTES	4	7	3280	3280	1	4	A Norman was ’t?
LAERTES	4	7	3282	3282	1	4	Upon my life, Lamord.
LAERTES	4	7	3284	3285	2	15	I know him well. He is the brooch indeed<br>And gem of all the nation.
LAERTES	4	7	3299	3299	1	6	What out of this, my lord?
LAERTES	4	7	3303	3303	1	4	Why ask you this?
LAERTES	4	7	3322	3322	1	7	To cut his throat i’ th’ church.
LAERTES	4	7	3337	3346	10	74	I will do ’t,<br>And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.<br>I bought an unction of a mountebank<br>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br>That is but scratched withal. I’ll touch my point<br>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br>It may be death.
LAERTES	4	7	3367	3367	1	3	Drowned? O, where?
LAERTES	4	7	3387	3387	1	5	Alas, then she is drowned.
LAERTES	4	7	3389	3395	7	58	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,<br>And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet<br>It is our trick; nature her custom holds,<br>Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,<br>The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord.<br>I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze,<br>But that this folly drowns it.
LAERTES	5	1	3629	3629	1	3	What ceremony else?
LAERTES	5	1	3631	3631	1	3	What ceremony else?
LAERTES	5	1	3642	3642	1	6	Must there no more be done?
LAERTES	5	1	3647	3651	5	31	Lay her i’ th’ earth,<br>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br>May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,<br>A minist’ring angel shall my sister be<br>When thou liest howling.
LAERTES	5	1	3657	3665	9	69	O, treble woe<br>Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head<br>Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense<br>Deprived thee of!—Hold off the earth awhile,<br>Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.<br>Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,<br>Till of this flat a mountain you have made<br>T’ o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head<br>Of blue Olympus.
LAERTES	5	1	3671	3671	1	5	The devil take thy soul!
LAERTES	5	2	3977	3985	9	68	I am satisfied in nature,<br>Whose motive in this case should stir me most<br>To my revenge; but in my terms of honor<br>I stand aloof and will no reconcilement<br>Till by some elder masters of known honor<br>I have a voice and precedent of peace<br>To keep my name ungored. But till that time<br>I do receive your offered love like love<br>And will not wrong it.
LAERTES	5	2	3989	3989	1	4	Come, one for me.
LAERTES	5	2	3993	3993	1	4	You mock me, sir.
LAERTES	5	2	4001	4001	1	8	This is too heavy. Let me see another.
LAERTES	5	2	4018	4018	1	3	Come, my lord.
LAERTES	5	2	4020	4020	1	1	No.
LAERTES	5	2	4023	4023	1	2	Well, again.
LAERTES	5	2	4029	4029	1	8	A touch, a touch. I do confess ’t.
LAERTES	5	2	4040	4040	1	6	My lord, I’ll hit him now.
LAERTES	5	2	4042	4042	1	8	And yet it is almost against my conscience.
LAERTES	5	2	4046	4046	1	5	Say you so? Come on.
LAERTES	5	2	4048	4048	1	4	Have at you now!
LAERTES	5	2	4054	4055	2	19	Why as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.<br>I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
LAERTES	5	2	4062	4069	8	65	It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.<br>No med’cine in the world can do thee good.<br>In thee there is not half an hour’s life.<br>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br>Unbated and envenomed. The foul practice<br>Hath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,<br>Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poisoned.<br>I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.
LAERTES	5	2	4077	4081	5	30	He is justly served.<br>It is a poison tempered by himself.<br>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.<br>Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,<br>Nor thine on me.
LORD-HAM	5	2	3927	3931	5	42	My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by<br>young Osric, who brings back to him that you<br>attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your<br>pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will<br>take longer time.
LORD-HAM	5	2	3936	3936	1	9	The King and Queen and all are coming down.
LORD-HAM	5	2	3938	3939	2	16	The Queen desires you to use some gentle<br>entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

MARCELLUS	1	1	153	153	1	7	Shall I strike it with my partisan?
MARCELLUS	1	1	157	161	5	29	’Tis gone.<br>We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>To offer it the show of violence,<br>For it is as the air, invulnerable,<br>And our vain blows malicious mockery.
MARCELLUS	1	1	17	17	1	5	And liegemen to the Dane.

MARCELLUS	1	1	19	20	2	8	O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved<br>you?
MARCELLUS	1	1	22	22	1	2	Holla, Barnardo.
MARCELLUS	1	1	28	34	7	53	Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy<br>And will not let belief take hold of him<br>Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.<br>Therefore I have entreated him along<br>With us to watch the minutes of this night,<br>That, if again this apparition come,<br>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
MARCELLUS	1	1	47	47	1	9	Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.
MARCELLUS	1	1	49	49	1	8	Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
MARCELLUS	1	1	53	53	1	4	Speak to it, Horatio.
MARCELLUS	1	1	59	59	1	3	It is offended.
MARCELLUS	1	1	62	62	1	6	’Tis gone and will not answer.
MARCELLUS	1	1	69	69	1	6	Is it not like the King?
MARCELLUS	1	1	76	77	2	18	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
MARCELLUS	1	1	81	90	10	81	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br>Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon<br>And foreign mart for implements of war,<br>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>Does not divide the Sunday from the week.<br>What might be toward that this sweaty haste<br>Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?<br>Who is ’t that can inform me?
MARCELLUS	1	2	362	362	1	3	My good lord.
MARCELLUS	1	2	414	414	1	8	My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
MARCELLUS	1	2	429	429	1	4	We do, my lord.
MARCELLUS	1	2	431	431	1	3	Armed, my lord.
MARCELLUS	1	2	433	433	1	6	My lord, from head to foot.
MARCELLUS	1	2	447	447	1	2	Longer, longer.
MARCELLUS	1	2	465	465	1	5	Our duty to your Honor.
MARCELLUS	1	4	621	621	1	4	No, it is struck.
MARCELLUS	1	4	682	684	3	19	Look with what courteous action<br>It waves you to a more removèd ground.<br>But do not go with it.
MARCELLUS	1	4	704	704	1	6	You shall not go, my lord.
MARCELLUS	1	4	714	714	1	9	Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.
MARCELLUS	1	4	716	716	1	8	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
MARCELLUS	1	4	718	718	1	4	Nay, let’s follow him.
MARCELLUS	1	5	839	839	1	2	Lord Hamlet.
MARCELLUS	1	5	842	842	1	5	Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
MARCELLUS	1	5	844	844	1	6	How is ’t, my noble lord?
MARCELLUS	1	5	850	850	1	4	Nor I, my lord.
MARCELLUS	1	5	854	854	1	5	 Ay, by heaven, my lord.

OPHELIA	1	3	483	483	1	4	No more but so?
OPHELIA	1	3	520	526	7	54	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep<br>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,<br>Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,<br>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads<br>And recks not his own rede.
OPHELIA	1	3	563	564	2	14	’Tis in my memory locked,<br>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
OPHELIA	1	3	567	568	2	8	So please you, something touching the Lord<br>Hamlet.
OPHELIA	1	3	579	580	2	14	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>Of his affection to me.
OPHELIA	1	3	584	584	1	10	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
OPHELIA	1	3	590	591	2	11	My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br>In honorable fashion—
OPHELIA	1	3	593	594	2	17	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
OPHELIA	1	3	616	616	1	5	I shall obey, my lord.
OPHELIA	2	1	1015	1015	1	10	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
OPHELIA	2	1	1017	1024	8	64	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,<br>No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,<br>Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle,<br>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,<br>And with a look so piteous in purport<br>As if he had been loosèd out of hell<br>To speak of horrors—he comes before me.
OPHELIA	2	1	1026	1027	2	12	My lord, I do not know,<br>But truly I do fear it.
OPHELIA	2	1	1029	1042	14	125	He took me by the wrist and held me hard.<br>Then goes he to the length of all his arm,<br>And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,<br>He falls to such perusal of my face<br>As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.<br>At last, a little shaking of mine arm,<br>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound<br>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>And end his being. That done, he lets me go,<br>And, with his head over his shoulder turned,<br>He seemed to find his way without his eyes,<br>For out o’ doors he went without their helps<br>And to the last bended their light on me.
OPHELIA	2	1	1050	1052	3	20	No, my good lord, but as you did command<br>I did repel his letters and denied<br>His access to me.
OPHELIA	3	1	1745	1745	1	5	Madam, I wish it may.
OPHELIA	3	1	1797	1798	2	12	Good my lord,<br>How does your Honor for this many a day?
OPHELIA	3	1	1800	1802	3	20	My lord, I have remembrances of yours<br>That I have longèd long to redeliver.<br>I pray you now receive them.
OPHELIA	3	1	1804	1810	7	46	My honored lord, you know right well you did,<br>And with them words of so sweet breath composed<br>As made the things more rich. Their perfume<br>lost,<br>Take these again, for to the noble mind<br>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br>There, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	1	1812	1812	1	2	My lord?

OPHELIA	3	1	1817	1818	2	10	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce<br>than with honesty?
OPHELIA	3	1	1824	1824	1	8	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
OPHELIA	3	1	1828	1828	1	5	I was the more deceived.
OPHELIA	3	1	1840	1840	1	4	At home, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	1	1843	1843	1	6	O, help him, you sweet heavens!
OPHELIA	3	1	1851	1851	1	4	Heavenly powers, restore him!
OPHELIA	3	1	1861	1873	13	99	O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!<br>The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue,<br>sword,<br>Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br>The glass of fashion and the mold of form,<br>Th’ observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br>That sucked the honey of his musicked vows,<br>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br>Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;<br>That unmatched form and stature of blown youth<br>Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me<br>T’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
OPHELIA	3	2	2021	2021	1	3	No, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2023	2023	1	3	Ay, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2025	2025	1	5	I think nothing, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2028	2028	1	4	What is, my lord?
OPHELIA	3	2	2030	2030	1	5	You are merry, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2032	2032	1	3	Ay, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2037	2037	1	7	Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2058	2058	1	5	What means this, my lord?
OPHELIA	3	2	2061	2062	2	9	Belike this show imports the argument of the<br>play.
OPHELIA	3	2	2065	2065	1	8	Will he tell us what this show meant?
OPHELIA	3	2	2069	2070	2	10	You are naught, you are naught. I’ll mark the<br>play.
OPHELIA	3	2	2075	2075	1	4	’Tis brief, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2170	2170	1	9	You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
OPHELIA	3	2	2173	2173	1	8	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
OPHELIA	3	2	2176	2176	1	4	Still better and worse.
OPHELIA	3	2	2192	2192	1	3	The King rises.

OSRIC	5	2	3810	3811	2	8	Your lordship is right welcome back to<br>Denmark.
OSRIC	5	2	3820	3821	2	18	Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I<br>should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
OSRIC	5	2	3825	3825	1	8	I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.
OSRIC	5	2	3828	3828	1	7	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
OSRIC	5	2	3831	3834	4	37	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as<br>’twere—I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty<br>bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager<br>on your head. Sir, this is the matter—
OSRIC	5	2	3836	3842	7	64	Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.<br>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes—believe<br>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent<br>differences, of very soft society and great showing.<br>Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or<br>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the<br>continent of what part a gentleman would see.
OSRIC	5	2	3852	3852	1	7	Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
OSRIC	5	2	3855	3855	1	1	Sir?
OSRIC	5	2	3860	3860	1	2	Of Laertes?
OSRIC	5	2	3864	3864	1	6	I know you are not ignorant—

OSRIC	5	2	3878	3884	7	57	The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary<br>horses, against the which he has impawned, as I<br>take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their<br>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the<br>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very<br>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and<br>of very liberal conceit.
OSRIC	5	2	3888	3888	1	6	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
OSRIC	5	2	3896	3900	5	43	The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen<br>passes between yourself and him, he shall not<br>exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for<br>nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your<br>Lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

OSRIC	5	2	4003	4003	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
OSRIC	5	2	4022	4022	1	6	A hit, a very palpable hit.

POLONIUS	2	2	1253	1253	1	6	Do you know me, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1255	1255	1	4	Not I, my lord.
POLONIUS	2	2	1257	1257	1	3	Honest, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1260	1260	1	5	That’s very true, my lord.

POLONIUS	2	2	1268	1273	6	52	How say you by that? Still harping on<br>my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I<br>was a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my<br>youth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near<br>this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my<br>lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1275	1275	1	6	What is the matter, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1277	1277	1	9	I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
POLONIUS	2	2	1287	1288	2	19	Though this be madness, yet there is<br>method in ’t.—Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1290	1296	7	56	Indeed, that’s out of the air. How<br>pregnant sometimes his replies are!

I<br>will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of<br>meeting between him and my daughter.—My lord,<br>I will take my leave of you.

POLONIUS	2	2	1468	1468	1	5	Well be with you, gentlemen.
POLONIUS	2	2	1477	1477	1	8	My lord, I have news to tell you.
POLONIUS	2	2	1480	1480	1	7	The actors are come hither, my lord.
POLONIUS	2	2	1482	1482	1	3	Upon my honor—
POLONIUS	2	2	1484	1490	7	43	The best actors in the world, either for<br>tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,<br>historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,<br>tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or<br>poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor<br>Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,<br>these are the only men.
POLONIUS	2	2	1493	1493	1	7	What a treasure had he, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1497	1497	1	4	Still on my daughter.
POLONIUS	2	2	1499	1500	2	16	If you call me <span class="quote" data-words="1">Jephthah,</span> my lord: I have a<br>daughter that I love passing well.
POLONIUS	2	2	1502	1502	1	5	What follows then, my lord?
POLONIUS	2	2	1555	1556	2	12	’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good<br>accent and good discretion.
POLONIUS	2	2	1587	1587	1	4	This is too long.
POLONIUS	2	2	1593	1593	1	6	That’s good. <span class="quote" data-words="2">Moblèd queen</span> is good.
POLONIUS	2	2	1609	1610	2	17	Look whe’er he has not turned his color and<br>has tears in ’s eyes. Prithee, no more.
POLONIUS	2	2	1617	1618	2	10	My lord, I will use them according to their<br>desert.
POLONIUS	2	2	1624	1624	1	2	Come, sirs.
POLONIUS	3	1	1721	1723	3	17	’Tis most true,<br>And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties<br>To hear and see the matter.
POLONIUS	3	1	1746	1753	8	53	Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you,<br>We will bestow ourselves. Read on this<br>book,<br>That show of such an exercise may color<br>Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this<br>(’Tis too much proved), that with devotion’s visage<br>And pious action we do sugar o’er<br>The devil himself.
POLONIUS	3	1	1761	1761	1	8	I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.
POLONIUS	3	1	1888	1899	12	100	It shall do well. But yet do I believe<br>The origin and commencement of his grief<br>Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?<br>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;<br>We heard it all.—My lord, do as you please,<br>But, if you hold it fit, after the play<br>Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him<br>To show his grief. Let her be round with him;<br>And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear<br>Of all their conference. If she find him not,<br>To England send him, or confine him where<br>Your wisdom best shall think.
POLONIUS	3	2	1951	1951	1	7	And the Queen too, and that presently.
POLONIUS	3	2	2007	2008	2	11	That did I, my lord, and was accounted a<br>good actor.
POLONIUS	3	2	2010	2011	2	14	I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i’ th’<br>Capitol. Brutus killed me.
POLONIUS	3	2	2019	2019	1	6	Oh, ho! Do you mark that?
POLONIUS	3	2	2195	2195	1	4	Give o’er the play.
POLONIUS	3	2	2197	2197	1	3	Lights, lights, lights!
POLONIUS	3	2	2305	2306	2	10	My lord, the Queen would speak with you,<br>and presently.
POLONIUS	3	2	2309	2309	1	9	By th’ Mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
POLONIUS	3	2	2311	2311	1	6	It is backed like a weasel.
POLONIUS	3	2	2313	2313	1	4	Very like a whale.
POLONIUS	3	2	2317	2317	1	4	I will say so.
POLONIUS	3	3	2362	2371	10	73	My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.<br>Behind the arras I’ll convey myself<br>To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him<br>home;<br>And, as you said (and wisely was it said),<br>’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,<br>Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear<br>The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.<br>I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed<br>And tell you what I know.
POLONIUS	3	4	2437	2443	7	45	He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.<br>Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear<br>with<br>And that your Grace hath screened and stood<br>between<br>Much heat and him. I’ll silence me even here.<br>Pray you, be round with him.
POLONIUS	3	4	2464	2464	1	3	What ho! Help!
POLONIUS	3	4	2466	2466	1	4	O, I am slain!

REYNALDO	2	1	1006	1006	1	4	My lord, I have.
REYNALDO	2	1	1008	1008	1	3	Good my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	1010	1010	1	4	I shall, my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	1012	1012	1	3	Well, my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	932	932	1	4	I will, my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	936	936	1	6	My lord, I did intend it.
REYNALDO	2	1	948	948	1	5	Ay, very well, my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	957	957	1	4	As gaming, my lord.
REYNALDO	2	1	960	960	1	6	My lord, that would dishonor him.
REYNALDO	2	1	970	970	1	4	But, my good lord—
REYNALDO	2	1	972	972	1	7	Ay, my lord, I would know that.
REYNALDO	2	1	985	985	1	4	Very good, my lord.

ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1091	1094	4	22	Both your Majesties<br>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br>Put your dread pleasures more into command<br>Than to entreaty.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1303	1303	1	4	God save you, sir.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1305	1305	1	4	My most dear lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1309	1309	1	7	As the indifferent children of the earth.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1313	1313	1	3	Neither, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1319	1320	2	9	None, my lord, but that the world’s<br>grown honest.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1327	1327	1	5	Then is the world one.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1331	1331	1	6	We think not so, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1335	1336	2	13	Why, then, your ambition makes it one.<br>’Tis too narrow for your mind.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1344	1345	2	19	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy<br>and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1350	1350	1	4	We’ll wait upon you.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1356	1356	1	8	To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1369	1369	1	5	To what end, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1376	1376	1	3	What say you?
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1399	1400	2	10	My lord, there was no such stuff in my<br>thoughts.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1403	1406	4	34	To think, my lord, if you delight not in<br>man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall<br>receive from you. We coted them on the way, and<br>hither are they coming to offer you service.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1415	1416	2	15	Even those you were wont to take such<br>delight in, the tragedians of the city.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1419	1420	2	12	I think their inhibition comes by the<br>means of the late innovation.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1423	1423	1	5	No, indeed are they not.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1425	1431	7	62	Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted<br>pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little<br>eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are<br>most tyrannically clapped for ’t. These are now the<br>fashion and so berattle the common stages (so<br>they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid<br>of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1439	1443	5	43	Faith, there has been much to-do on<br>both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar<br>them to controversy. There was for a while no<br>money bid for argument unless the poet and the<br>player went to cuffs in the question.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1448	1449	2	11	Ay, that they do, my lord—Hercules<br>and his load too.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1472	1473	2	19	Haply he is the second time come to<br>them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
ROSENCRANTZ	2	2	1638	1638	1	3	Good my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	1	1703	1704	2	17	He does confess he feels himself distracted,<br>But from what cause he will by no means speak.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	1	1710	1710	1	4	Most like a gentleman.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	1	1712	1713	2	12	Niggard of question, but of our demands<br>Most free in his reply.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	1	1715	1720	6	52	Madam, it so fell out that certain players<br>We o’erraught on the way. Of these we told him,<br>And there did seem in him a kind of joy<br>To hear of it. They are here about the court,<br>And, as I think, they have already order<br>This night to play before him.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	1	1728	1728	1	4	We shall, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	1954	1954	1	3	Ay, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2014	2015	2	8	Ay, my lord. They stay upon your<br>patience.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2249	2249	1	3	What, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2255	2256	2	13	Then thus she says: your behavior hath<br>struck her into amazement and admiration.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2260	2261	2	14	She desires to speak with you in her<br>closet ere you go to bed.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2264	2264	1	7	My lord, you once did love me.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2266	2268	3	27	Good my lord, what is your cause of<br>distemper? You do surely bar the door upon your<br>own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	2	2270	2272	3	18	How can that be, when you have the<br>voice of the King himself for your succession in<br>Denmark?
ROSENCRANTZ	3	3	2345	2357	13	104	The single and peculiar life is bound<br>With all the strength and armor of the mind<br>To keep itself from noyance, but much more<br>That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests<br>The lives of many. The cess of majesty<br>Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw<br>What’s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel<br>Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,<br>To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things<br>Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,<br>Each small annexment, petty consequence,<br>Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone<br>Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
ROSENCRANTZ	3	3	2361	2361	1	4	We will haste us.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2727	2727	1	10	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2729	2730	2	16	Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence<br>And bear it to the chapel.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2732	2732	1	2	Believe what?
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2736	2736	1	8	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2744	2744	1	6	I understand you not, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	2	2747	2748	2	17	My lord, you must tell us where the<br>body is and go with us to the King.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	3	2766	2767	2	13	Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,<br>We cannot get from him.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	3	2769	2769	1	8	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	3	2771	2771	1	5	Ho! Bring in the lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	4	4	2862	2862	1	7	Will ’t please you go, my lord?
SAILORS	4	6	3151	3151	1	4	God bless you, sir.
SAILORS	4	6	3153	3156	4	36	He shall, sir, an ’t please Him. There’s a letter<br>for you, sir. It came from th’ ambassador that was<br>bound for England—if your name be Horatio, as I<br>am let to know it is.
VOLTEMAND	1	2	230	230	1	10	In that and all things will we show our duty.
VOLTEMAND	2	2	1128	1149	22	153	Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br>His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared<br>To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack,<br>But, better looked into, he truly found<br>It was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved<br>That so his sickness, age, and impotence<br>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br>On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,<br>Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,<br>Makes vow before his uncle never more<br>To give th’ assay of arms against your Majesty.<br>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br>Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual<br>fee<br>And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br>So levied as before, against the Polack,<br>With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br>That it might please you to give quiet pass<br>Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br>On such regards of safety and allowance<br>As therein are set down.
