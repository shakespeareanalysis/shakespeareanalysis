ABRAM	1	1	59	59	1	8	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
ABRAM	1	1	61	61	1	8	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
ABRAM	1	1	68	68	1	4	Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
ABRAM	1	1	71	71	1	2	No better.
ABRAM	1	1	76	76	1	2	You lie.
APOTHECARY	5	1	2793	2793	1	4	Who calls so loud?
APOTHECARY	5	1	2802	2803	2	16	Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law<br>Is death to any he that utters them.
APOTHECARY	5	1	2811	2811	1	7	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
APOTHECARY	5	1	2813	2815	3	26	Put this in any liquid thing you will<br>And drink it off, and if you had the strength<br>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	1	2750	2756	7	56	Then she is well and nothing can be ill.<br>Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument,<br>And her immortal part with angels lives.<br>I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault<br>And presently took post to tell it you.<br>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,<br>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	1	2760	2762	3	18	I do beseech you, sir, have patience.<br>Your looks are pale and wild and do import<br>Some misadventure.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	1	2766	2766	1	4	No, my good lord.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2893	2893	1	9	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2896	2897	2	17	For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.<br>His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2976	2976	1	10	Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2981	2982	2	13	It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,<br>One that you love.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2984	2984	1	1	Romeo.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2986	2986	1	4	Full half an hour.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2988	2991	4	29	I dare not, sir.<br>My master knows not but I am gone hence,<br>And fearfully did menace me with death<br>If I did stay to look on his intents.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	2994	2996	3	22	As I did sleep under this yew tree here,<br>I dreamt my master and another fought,<br>And that my master slew him.
BALTHASAR-ROM	5	3	3134	3139	6	50	I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,<br>And then in post he came from Mantua<br>To this same place, to this same monument.<br>This letter he early bid me give his father<br>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<br>If I departed not and left him there.
BENVOLIO	1	1	122	131	10	81	Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.<br>I drew to part them. In the instant came<br>The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,<br>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.<br>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows<br>Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
BENVOLIO	1	1	134	147	14	101	Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun<br>Peered forth the golden window of the east,<br>A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,<br>Where underneath the grove of sycamore<br>That westward rooteth from this city side,<br>So early walking did I see your son.<br>Towards him I made, but he was ’ware of me<br>And stole into the covert of the wood.<br>I, measuring his affections by my own<br>(Which then most sought where most might not be<br>found,<br>Being one too many by my weary self),<br>Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,<br>And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
BENVOLIO	1	1	160	160	1	8	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
BENVOLIO	1	1	162	162	1	7	Have you importuned him by any means?
BENVOLIO	1	1	173	174	2	17	See where he comes. So please you, step aside.<br>I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
BENVOLIO	1	1	177	177	1	3	Good morrow, cousin.
BENVOLIO	1	1	179	179	1	4	But new struck nine.
BENVOLIO	1	1	182	182	1	7	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
BENVOLIO	1	1	184	184	1	2	In love?
BENVOLIO	1	1	186	186	1	2	Of love?
BENVOLIO	1	1	188	189	2	16	Alas that love, so gentle in his view,<br>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
BENVOLIO	1	1	203	203	1	5	No, coz, I rather weep.
BENVOLIO	1	1	205	205	1	5	At thy good heart’s oppression.
BENVOLIO	1	1	217	218	2	15	Soft, I will go along.<br>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
BENVOLIO	1	1	221	221	1	9	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
BENVOLIO	1	1	223	223	1	8	Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.
BENVOLIO	1	1	227	227	1	9	I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
BENVOLIO	1	1	229	229	1	9	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
BENVOLIO	1	1	239	239	1	10	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
BENVOLIO	1	1	247	247	1	9	Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
BENVOLIO	1	1	249	250	2	9	By giving liberty unto thine eyes.<br>Examine other beauties.
BENVOLIO	1	1	261	261	1	9	I’ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.
BENVOLIO	1	1	79	80	2	15	Part, fools!<br>Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
BENVOLIO	1	1	83	84	2	19	I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,<br>Or manage it to part these men with me.
BENVOLIO	1	2	308	313	6	47	Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning;<br>One pain is lessened by another’s anguish.<br>Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.<br>One desperate grief cures with another’s languish.<br>Take thou some new infection to thy eye,<br>And the rank poison of the old will die.
BENVOLIO	1	2	315	315	1	5	For what, I pray thee?
BENVOLIO	1	2	317	317	1	5	Why Romeo, art thou mad?
BENVOLIO	1	2	350	355	6	47	At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s<br>Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,<br>With all the admirèd beauties of Verona.<br>Go thither, and with unattainted eye<br>Compare her face with some that I shall show,<br>And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
BENVOLIO	1	2	362	367	6	51	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,<br>Herself poised with herself in either eye;<br>But in that crystal scales let there be weighed<br>Your lady’s love against some other maid<br>That I will show you shining at this feast,<br>And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
BENVOLIO	1	4	485	492	8	57	The date is out of such prolixity.<br>We’ll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,<br>Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,<br>Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,<br>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke<br>After the prompter, for our entrance.<br>But let them measure us by what they will.<br>We’ll measure them a measure and be gone.
BENVOLIO	1	4	515	516	2	16	Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in<br>But every man betake him to his legs.
BENVOLIO	1	4	593	594	2	18	This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.<br>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
BENVOLIO	1	4	603	603	1	2	Strike, drum.
BENVOLIO	1	5	736	736	1	8	Away, begone. The sport is at the best.
BENVOLIO	2	1	780	780	1	5	Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo!
BENVOLIO	2	1	783	784	2	12	He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.<br>Call, good Mercutio.
BENVOLIO	2	1	802	802	1	9	An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
BENVOLIO	2	1	810	812	3	24	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees<br>To be consorted with the humorous night.<br>Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
BENVOLIO	2	1	822	823	2	16	Go, then, for ’tis in vain<br>To seek him here that means not to be found.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1132	1132	1	9	Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1136	1137	2	14	Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,<br>Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1139	1139	1	4	Romeo will answer it.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1141	1142	2	12	Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how<br>he dares, being dared.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1148	1148	1	4	Why, what is Tybalt?
BENVOLIO	2	4	1157	1157	1	2	The what?
BENVOLIO	2	4	1167	1167	1	6	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1225	1225	1	4	Stop there, stop there.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1228	1228	1	8	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
BENVOLIO	2	4	1260	1260	1	7	She will indite him to some supper.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1469	1472	4	35	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.<br>The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,<br>And if we meet we shall not ’scape a brawl,<br>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1479	1479	1	6	Am I like such a fellow?
BENVOLIO	3	1	1483	1483	1	3	And what to?
BENVOLIO	3	1	1500	1502	3	26	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any<br>man should buy the fee simple of my life for an<br>hour and a quarter.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1504	1504	1	7	By my head, here comes the Capulets.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1519	1522	4	30	We talk here in the public haunt of men.<br>Either withdraw unto some private place,<br>Or reason coldly of your grievances,<br>Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1564	1564	1	4	What, art thou hurt?
BENVOLIO	3	1	1589	1591	3	22	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.<br>That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,<br>Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1594	1594	1	7	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1606	1609	4	27	Romeo, away, begone!<br>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.<br>Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death<br>If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1611	1611	1	4	Why dost thou stay?
BENVOLIO	3	1	1614	1614	1	4	There lies that Tybalt.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1618	1621	4	28	O noble prince, I can discover all<br>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.<br>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,<br>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
BENVOLIO	3	1	1628	1652	25	189	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay—<br>Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink<br>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br>Your high displeasure. All this utterèd<br>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed<br>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,<br>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point<br>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>Cold death aside and with the other sends<br>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br>Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Hold, friends! Friends, part!</span> and swifter than his<br>tongue<br>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.<br>But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br>Who had but newly entertained revenge,<br>And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I<br>Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,<br>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
CAPULET	1	1	90	90	1	10	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
CAPULET	1	1	93	94	2	16	My sword, I say. Old Montague is come<br>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
CAPULET	1	2	262	264	3	27	But Montague is bound as well as I,<br>In penalty alike, and ’tis not hard, I think,<br>For men so old as we to keep the peace.
CAPULET	1	2	268	272	5	44	But saying o’er what I have said before.<br>My child is yet a stranger in the world.<br>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.<br>Let two more summers wither in their pride<br>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
CAPULET	1	2	274	299	26	205	And too soon marred are those so early made.<br>Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;<br>She’s the hopeful lady of my earth.<br>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;<br>My will to her consent is but a part.<br>And, she agreed, within her scope of choice<br>Lies my consent and fair according voice.<br>This night I hold an old accustomed feast,<br>Whereto I have invited many a guest<br>Such as I love; and you among the store,<br>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.<br>At my poor house look to behold this night<br>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.<br>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel<br>When well-appareled April on the heel<br>Of limping winter treads, even such delight<br>Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night<br>Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,<br>And like her most whose merit most shall be;<br>Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,<br>May stand in number, though in reck’ning none.<br>Come go with me.<br>Go, sirrah, trudge about<br>Through fair Verona, find those persons out<br>Whose names are written there, and to them say<br>My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
CAPULET	1	5	621	641	21	155	Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes<br>Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with<br>you.—<br>Ah, my mistresses, which of you all<br>Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,<br>She, I’ll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you<br>now?—<br>Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day<br>That I have worn a visor and could tell<br>A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,<br>Such as would please. ’Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.<br>You are welcome, gentlemen.—Come, musicians,<br>play.<br>A hall, a hall, give room!—And foot it, girls.—<br>More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,<br>And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.—<br>Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.—<br>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,<br>For you and I are past our dancing days.<br>How long is ’t now since last yourself and I<br>Were in a mask?
CAPULET	1	5	642	642	1	5	By ’r Lady, thirty years.
CAPULET	1	5	643	646	4	32	What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much.<br>’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,<br>Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,<br>Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.
CAPULET	1	5	647	648	2	13	’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.<br>His son is thirty.
CAPULET	1	5	649	650	2	14	Will you tell me that?<br>His son was but a ward two years ago.
CAPULET	1	5	671	671	1	8	Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
CAPULET	1	5	675	675	1	4	Young Romeo is it?
CAPULET	1	5	677	686	10	78	Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.<br>He bears him like a portly gentleman,<br>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him<br>To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.<br>I would not for the wealth of all this town<br>Here in my house do him disparagement.<br>Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.<br>It is my will, the which if thou respect,<br>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,<br>An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
CAPULET	1	5	689	694	6	46	He shall be endured.<br>What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.<br>Am I the master here or you? Go to.<br>You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,<br>You’ll make a mutiny among my guests,<br>You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!
CAPULET	1	5	696	702	7	56	Go to, go to.<br>You are a saucy boy. Is ’t so indeed?<br>This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.<br>You must contrary me. Marry, ’tis time—<br>Well said, my hearts.—You are a princox, go.<br>Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—for shame,<br>I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!
CAPULET	1	5	738	744	7	52	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.<br>We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.—<br>Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all.<br>I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.—<br>More torches here.—Come on then, let’s to bed.—<br>Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.<br>I’ll to my rest.
CAPULET	3	4	2019	2025	7	58	Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily<br>That we have had no time to move our daughter.<br>Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,<br>And so did I. Well, we were born to die.<br>’Tis very late. She’ll not come down tonight.<br>I promise you, but for your company,<br>I would have been abed an hour ago.
CAPULET	3	4	2031	2038	8	62	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender<br>Of my child’s love. I think she will be ruled<br>In all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.—<br>Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.<br>Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,<br>And bid her—mark you me?—on Wednesday<br>next—<br>But soft, what day is this?
CAPULET	3	4	2040	2049	10	84	Monday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.<br>O’ Thursday let it be.—O’ Thursday, tell her,<br>She shall be married to this noble earl.—<br>Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?<br>We’ll keep no great ado: a friend or two.<br>For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,<br>It may be thought we held him carelessly,<br>Being our kinsman, if we revel much.<br>Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,<br>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
CAPULET	3	4	2051	2056	6	54	Well, get you gone. O’ Thursday be it, then.<br>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.<br>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.—<br>Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!—<br>Afore me, it is so very late that we<br>May call it early by and by.—Good night.
CAPULET	3	5	2187	2199	13	101	When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,<br>But for the sunset of my brother’s son<br>It rains downright.<br>How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?<br>Evermore show’ring? In one little body<br>Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.<br>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,<br>Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,<br>Without a sudden calm, will overset<br>Thy tempest-tossèd body.—How now, wife?<br>Have you delivered to her our decree?
CAPULET	3	5	2202	2206	5	46	Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br>How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?<br>Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,<br>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br>So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
CAPULET	3	5	2210	2218	9	70	How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Proud,</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="3">I thank you,</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="4">I thank you not,</span><br>And yet <span class="quote" data-words="2">not proud</span>? Mistress minion you,<br>Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,<br>But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next<br>To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,<br>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br>Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!<br>You tallow face!
CAPULET	3	5	2222	2231	10	73	Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!<br>I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday,<br>Or never after look me in the face.<br>Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.<br>My fingers itch.—Wife, we scarce thought us<br>blessed<br>That God had lent us but this only child,<br>But now I see this one is one too much,<br>And that we have a curse in having her.<br>Out on her, hilding.
CAPULET	3	5	2234	2235	2	15	And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.<br>Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.
CAPULET	3	5	2237	2237	1	5	O, God ’i’ g’ eden!
CAPULET	3	5	2239	2241	3	17	Peace, you mumbling fool!<br>Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,<br>For here we need it not.
CAPULET	3	5	2243	2262	21	174	God’s bread, it makes me mad.<br>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br>Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br>To have her matched. And having now provided<br>A gentleman of noble parentage,<br>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,<br>Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,<br>Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man—<br>And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,<br>To answer <span class="quote" data-words="15">I’ll not wed.

I’ll not be forsworn.
CAPULET	4	2	2441	2442	2	25	So many guests invite as here are writ.<br>Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
CAPULET	4	2	2445	2445	1	6	How canst thou try them so?
CAPULET	4	2	2449	2451	3	20	Go, begone.<br>We shall be much unfurnished for this time.—<br>What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
CAPULET	4	2	2453	2454	2	16	Well, he may chance to do some good on her.<br>A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.
CAPULET	4	2	2456	2457	2	9	How now, my headstrong, where have you been<br>gadding?
CAPULET	4	2	2464	2465	2	17	Send for the County. Go tell him of this.<br>I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
CAPULET	4	2	2469	2473	5	49	Why, I am glad on ’t. This is well. Stand up.<br>This is as ’t should be.—Let me see the County.<br>Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.—<br>Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,<br>All our whole city is much bound to him.
CAPULET	4	2	2478	2478	1	9	Go, nurse. Go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.
CAPULET	4	2	2481	2489	9	72	Tush, I will stir about,<br>And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.<br>Go thou to Juliet. Help to deck up her.<br>I’ll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.<br>I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What ho!—<br>They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself<br>To County Paris, to prepare up him<br>Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light<br>Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.
CAPULET	4	4	2552	2555	4	28	Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed.<br>The curfew bell hath rung. ’Tis three o’clock.—<br>Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.<br>Spare not for cost.
CAPULET	4	4	2559	2560	2	19	No, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now<br>All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.
CAPULET	4	4	2563	2565	3	22	A jealous hood, a jealous hood!<br>Now fellow,<br>What is there?
CAPULET	4	4	2567	2569	3	20	Make haste, make haste.<br>Sirrah, fetch drier logs.<br>Call Peter. He will show thee where they are.
CAPULET	4	4	2572	2581	10	78	Mass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!<br>Thou shalt be loggerhead.<br>Good faith, ’tis day.<br>The County will be here with music straight,<br>For so he said he would. I hear him near.—<br>Nurse!—Wife! What ho!—What, nurse, I say!<br>Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.<br>I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,<br>Make haste. The bridegroom he is come already.<br>Make haste, I say.
CAPULET	4	5	2608	2608	1	9	For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come.
CAPULET	4	5	2611	2615	5	42	Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she’s cold.<br>Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.<br>Life and these lips have long been separated.<br>Death lies on her like an untimely frost<br>Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
CAPULET	4	5	2618	2619	2	20	Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,<br>Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
CAPULET	4	5	2621	2627	7	56	Ready to go, but never to return.—<br>O son, the night before thy wedding day<br>Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,<br>Flower as she was, deflowerèd by him.<br>Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.<br>My daughter he hath wedded. I will die<br>And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death’s.
CAPULET	4	5	2646	2651	6	42	Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!<br>Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now<br>To murder, murder our solemnity?<br>O child! O child! My soul and not my child!<br>Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,<br>And with my child my joys are burièd.
CAPULET	4	5	2671	2677	7	49	All things that we ordainèd festival<br>Turn from their office to black funeral:<br>Our instruments to melancholy bells,<br>Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,<br>Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,<br>Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<br>And all things change them to the contrary.
CAPULET	5	3	3050	3050	1	9	What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
CAPULET	5	3	3063	3066	4	31	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!<br>This dagger hath mista’en, for, lo, his house<br>Is empty on the back of Montague,<br>And it mis-sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom.
CAPULET	5	3	3159	3161	3	18	O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br>This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more<br>Can I demand.
CAPULET	5	3	3167	3168	2	13	As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,<br>Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
CAPULETS_COUSIN	1	5	642	642	1	5	By ’r Lady, thirty years.
CAPULETS_COUSIN	1	5	647	648	2	13	’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.<br>His son is thirty.
CHORUS		1	1	14	14	106	Two households, both alike in dignity<br>(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),<br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;<br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.<br>The fearful passage of their death-marked love<br>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,<br>Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,<br>Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;<br>The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
CHORUS	2		764	777	14	113	Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,<br>And young affection gapes to be his heir.<br>That fair for which love groaned for and would die,<br>With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.<br>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,<br>Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks,<br>But to his foe supposed he must complain,<br>And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.<br>Being held a foe, he may not have access<br>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,<br>And she as much in love, her means much less<br>To meet her new belovèd anywhere.<br>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,<br>Temp’ring extremities with extreme sweet.
CITIZENS	1	1	88	89	2	16	Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!<br>Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
CITIZENS	3	1	1612	1613	2	14	Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?<br>Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
CITIZENS	3	1	1615	1616	2	13	Up, sir, go with me.<br>I charge thee in the Prince’s name, obey.
ESCALUS-ROM	1	1	97	119	23	166	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>Profaners of this neighbor-stainèd steel—<br>Will they not hear?—What ho! You men, you beasts,<br>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>With purple fountains issuing from your veins:<br>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,<br>And hear the sentence of your movèd prince.<br>Three civil brawls bred of an airy word<br>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets<br>And made Verona’s ancient citizens<br>Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments<br>To wield old partisans in hands as old,<br>Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.<br>If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>For this time all the rest depart away.<br>You, Capulet, shall go along with me,<br>And, Montague, come you this afternoon<br>To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
ESCALUS-ROM	3	1	1617	1617	1	8	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
ESCALUS-ROM	3	1	1627	1627	1	6	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
ESCALUS-ROM	3	1	1659	1660	2	16	Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.<br>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
ESCALUS-ROM	3	1	1664	1675	12	94	And for that offense<br>Immediately we do exile him hence.<br>I have an interest in your hearts’ proceeding:<br>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.<br>But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br>That you shall all repent the loss of mine.<br>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.<br>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.<br>Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,<br>Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.<br>Bear hence this body and attend our will.<br>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3048	3049	2	14	What misadventure is so early up<br>That calls our person from our morning rest?
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3054	3054	1	9	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3058	3059	2	9	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder<br>comes.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3069	3070	2	16	Come, Montague, for thou art early up<br>To see thy son and heir now early down.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3074	3074	1	5	Look, and thou shalt see.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3077	3084	8	53	Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,<br>Till we can clear these ambiguities<br>And know their spring, their head, their true<br>descent,<br>And then will I be general of your woes<br>And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,<br>And let mischance be slave to patience.—<br>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3090	3090	1	10	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3132	3133	2	18	We still have known thee for a holy man.—<br>Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3140	3143	4	30	Give me the letter. I will look on it.—<br>Where is the County’s page, that raised the<br>watch?—<br>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3149	3158	10	85	This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,<br>Their course of love, the tidings of her death;<br>And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal<br>Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.<br>Where be these enemies?—Capulet, Montague,<br>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,<br>And I, for winking at your discords too,<br>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.
ESCALUS-ROM	5	3	3169	3174	6	49	A glooming peace this morning with it brings.<br>The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.<br>Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd.<br>For never was a story of more woe<br>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

FRIAR_JOHN	5	2	2824	2824	1	5	Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
FRIAR_JOHN	5	2	2828	2835	8	62	Going to find a barefoot brother out,<br>One of our order, to associate me,<br>Here in this city visiting the sick,<br>And finding him, the searchers of the town,<br>Suspecting that we both were in a house<br>Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<br>Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth,<br>So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.
FRIAR_JOHN	5	2	2837	2839	3	26	I could not send it—here it is again—<br>Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<br>So fearful were they of infection.
FRIAR_JOHN	5	2	2846	2846	1	7	Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1029	1059	31	238	The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,<br>Check’ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br>And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels<br>From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.<br>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br>The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry,<br>I must upfill this osier cage of ours<br>With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.<br>The Earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb;<br>What is her burying grave, that is her womb;<br>And from her womb children of divers kind<br>We sucking on her natural bosom find,<br>Many for many virtues excellent,<br>None but for some, and yet all different.<br>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br>In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.<br>For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live<br>But to the Earth some special good doth give;<br>Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,<br>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.<br>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,<br>And vice sometime by action dignified.<br>Within the infant rind of this weak flower<br>Poison hath residence and medicine power:<br>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each<br>part;<br>Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.<br>Two such opposèd kings encamp them still<br>In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will;<br>And where the worser is predominant,<br>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1061	1073	13	87	Benedicite.<br>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?<br>Young son, it argues a distempered head<br>So soon to bid <span class="quote" data-words="2">Good morrow</span> to thy bed.<br>Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,<br>And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;<br>But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain<br>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth<br>reign.<br>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<br>Thou art uproused with some distemp’rature,<br>Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:<br>Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1075	1075	1	7	God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1078	1079	2	10	That’s my good son. But where hast thou been<br>then?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1087	1088	2	15	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.<br>Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1097	1113	17	135	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<br>Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,<br>So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies<br>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br>Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br>How much salt water thrown away in waste<br>To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br>Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.<br>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br>Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.<br>If e’er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,<br>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.<br>And art thou changed?

FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1115	1115	1	7	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1117	1118	2	12	Not in a grave<br>To lay one in, another out to have.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1122	1127	6	44	O, she knew well<br>Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.<br>But come, young waverer, come, go with me.<br>In one respect I’ll thy assistant be,<br>For this alliance may so happy prove<br>To turn your households’ rancor to pure love.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	3	1129	1129	1	8	Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	6	1432	1433	2	15	So smile the heavens upon this holy act<br>That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	6	1440	1451	12	90	These violent delights have violent ends<br>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,<br>Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey<br>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness<br>And in the taste confounds the appetite.<br>Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.<br>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.<br>Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot<br>Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.<br>A lover may bestride the gossamers<br>That idles in the wanton summer air,<br>And yet not fall, so light is vanity.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	6	1453	1453	1	8	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	2	6	1466	1468	3	26	Come, come with me, and we will make short work,<br>For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone<br>Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1833	1835	3	20	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.<br>Affliction is enamored of thy parts,<br>And thou art wedded to calamity.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1839	1841	3	18	Too familiar<br>Is my dear son with such sour company.<br>I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1843	1844	2	13	A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:<br>Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1848	1849	2	15	Here from Verona art thou banishèd.<br>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1857	1862	6	41	O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!<br>Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,<br>Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law<br>And turned that black word <span class="quote" data-words="1">death</span> to<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">banishment.</span><br>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1887	1887	1	9	Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1889	1891	3	20	I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word,<br>Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,<br>To comfort thee, though thou art banishèd.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1896	1896	1	9	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1898	1898	1	8	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1907	1907	1	7	Arise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1910	1916	7	45	Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo,<br>arise.<br>Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.<br>Run to my study.—By and by.—God’s will,<br>What simpleness is this?—I come, I come.<br>Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What’s<br>your will?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1919	1919	1	2	Welcome, then.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1922	1923	2	10	There on the ground, with his own tears made<br>drunk.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	1950	2000	51	397	Hold thy desperate hand!<br>Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.<br>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<br>The unreasonable fury of a beast.<br>Unseemly woman in a seeming man,<br>And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,<br>I thought thy disposition better tempered.<br>Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,<br>And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,<br>By doing damnèd hate upon thyself?<br>Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,<br>Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet<br>In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?<br>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,<br>Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all<br>And usest none in that true use indeed<br>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.<br>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br>Digressing from the valor of a man;<br>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;<br>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,<br>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br>And thou dismembered with thine own defense.<br>What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,<br>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:<br>There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,<br>But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.<br>The law that threatened death becomes thy friend<br>And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.<br>A pack of blessings light upon thy back;<br>Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<br>Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.<br>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.<br>Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.<br>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,<br>Where thou shalt live till we can find a time<br>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back<br>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.—<br>Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,<br>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.<br>Romeo is coming.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	3	3	2008	2015	8	60	Go hence, good night—and here stands all your<br>state:<br>Either be gone before the watch be set<br>Or by the break of day disguised from hence.<br>Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,<br>And he shall signify from time to time<br>Every good hap to you that chances here.<br>Give me thy hand. ’Tis late. Farewell. Good night.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2312	2312	1	8	On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2315	2316	2	17	You say you do not know the lady’s mind?<br>Uneven is the course. I like it not.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2327	2328	2	19	I would I knew not why it should be slowed.—<br>Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2333	2333	1	4	That’s a certain text.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2351	2352	2	15	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—<br>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2358	2361	4	33	O Juliet, I already know thy grief.<br>It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>On Thursday next be married to this County.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2380	2388	9	72	Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,<br>Which craves as desperate an execution<br>As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>If, rather than to marry County Paris,<br>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>That cop’st with death himself to ’scape from it;<br>And if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2402	2433	32	258	Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent<br>To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.<br>Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>And this distilling liquor drink thou off;<br>When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse<br>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.<br>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.<br>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>To paly ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall<br>Like death when he shuts up the day of life.<br>Each part, deprived of supple government,<br>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,<br>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death<br>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours<br>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br>Then, as the manner of our country is,<br>In thy best robes uncovered on the bier<br>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,<br>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br>And hither shall he come, and he and I<br>Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br>If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br>Abate thy valor in the acting it.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	1	2435	2437	3	25	Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous<br>In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed<br>To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	5	2620	2620	1	9	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	5	2652	2670	19	157	Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion’s cure lives not<br>In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br>Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,<br>And all the better is it for the maid.<br>Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br>But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br>The most you sought was her promotion,<br>For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced;<br>And weep you now, seeing she is advanced<br>Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br>O, in this love you love your child so ill<br>That you run mad, seeing that she is well.<br>She’s not well married that lives married long,<br>But she’s best married that dies married young.<br>Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br>On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,<br>And in her best array, bear her to church,<br>For though fond nature bids us all lament,<br>Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	4	5	2678	2682	5	41	Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,<br>And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare<br>To follow this fair corse unto her grave.<br>The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.<br>Move them no more by crossing their high will.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	2	2825	2827	3	25	This same should be the voice of Friar John.—<br>Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?<br>Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	2	2836	2836	1	7	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	2	2840	2845	6	41	Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,<br>The letter was not nice but full of charge,<br>Of dear import, and the neglecting it<br>May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.<br>Get me an iron crow and bring it straight<br>Unto my cell.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	2	2847	2853	7	54	Now must I to the monument alone.<br>Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.<br>She will beshrew me much that Romeo<br>Hath had no notice of these accidents.<br>But I will write again to Mantua,<br>And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.<br>Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2974	2975	2	17	Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight<br>Have my old feet stumbled at graves!—Who’s there?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2977	2980	4	32	Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,<br>What torch is yond that vainly lends his light<br>To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,<br>It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2983	2983	1	3	Who is it?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2985	2985	1	6	How long hath he been there?
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2987	2987	1	6	Go with me to the vault.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2992	2993	2	17	Stay, then. I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.<br>O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	2997	3005	9	56	Romeo!—<br>Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains<br>The stony entrance of this sepulcher?<br>What mean these masterless and gory swords<br>To lie discolored by this place of peace?<br>Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?<br>And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!<br>The lady stirs.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	3009	3017	9	69	I hear some noise.—Lady, come from that nest<br>Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.<br>A greater power than we can contradict<br>Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<br>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,<br>And Paris, too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee<br>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.<br>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.<br>Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	3085	3089	5	38	I am the greatest, able to do least,<br>Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br>Doth make against me, of this direful murder.<br>And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br>Myself condemnèd and myself excused.
FRIAR_LAWRENCE	5	3	3091	3131	41	327	I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,<br>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.<br>I married them, and their stol’n marriage day<br>Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death<br>Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,<br>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>Betrothed and would have married her perforce<br>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,<br>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean<br>To rid her from this second marriage,<br>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)<br>A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br>As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br>That he should hither come as this dire night<br>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,<br>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.<br>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight<br>Returned my letter back. Then all alone<br>At the prefixèd hour of her waking<br>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,<br>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br>But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>Of her awakening, here untimely lay<br>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth<br>And bear this work of heaven with patience.<br>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br>And she, too desperate, would not go with me<br>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>All this I know, and to the marriage<br>Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this<br>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>Be sacrificed some hour before his time<br>Unto the rigor of severest law.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	16	16	1	7	No, for then we should be colliers.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	18	19	2	10	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of<br>collar.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	21	21	1	8	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	23	25	3	20	To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to<br>stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st<br>away.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	28	29	2	13	That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest<br>goes to the wall.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	34	35	2	10	The quarrel is between our masters and us<br>their men.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	39	39	1	5	The heads of the maids?
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	42	42	1	9	They must take it in sense that feel it.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	45	47	3	23	’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<br>hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes<br>of the house of Montagues.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	50	50	1	6	How? Turn thy back and run?
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	52	52	1	5	No, marry. I fear thee!
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	55	56	2	15	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it<br>as they list.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	64	64	1	1	No.
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	67	67	1	4	Do you quarrel, sir?
GREGORY-ROM	1	1	73	74	2	9	Say <span class="quote" data-words="1">better</span>; here comes<br>one of my master’s kinsmen.
JULIET-ROM	1	3	374	374	1	4	How now, who calls?
JULIET-ROM	1	3	376	376	1	8	Madam, I am here. What is your will?
JULIET-ROM	1	3	432	432	1	10	And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
JULIET-ROM	1	3	440	440	1	9	It is an honor that I dream not of.
JULIET-ROM	1	3	472	474	3	26	I’ll look to like, if looking liking move.<br>But no more deep will I endart mine eye<br>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	711	714	4	32	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,<br>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<br>For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,<br>And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	716	716	1	9	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	719	719	1	9	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	722	722	1	10	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	725	725	1	5	You kiss by th’ book.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	745	745	1	7	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
JULIET-ROM	1	5	747	747	1	9	What’s he that now is going out of door?
JULIET-ROM	1	5	749	749	1	9	What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
JULIET-ROM	1	5	751	752	2	20	Go ask his name. If he be marrièd,<br>My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	755	758	4	31	My only love sprung from my only hate!<br>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!<br>Prodigious birth of love it is to me<br>That I must love a loathèd enemy.
JULIET-ROM	1	5	760	761	2	11	A rhyme I learned even now<br>Of one I danced withal.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1001	1001	1	1	Romeo.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1003	1004	2	8	What o’clock tomorrow<br>Shall I send to thee?
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1006	1007	2	18	I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then.<br>I have forgot why I did call thee back.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1009	1010	2	15	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br>Rememb’ring how I love thy company.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1013	1018	6	47	’Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,<br>And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,<br>That lets it hop a little from his hand,<br>Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>And with a silken thread plucks it back again,<br>So loving-jealous of his liberty.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	1020	1024	5	31	Sweet, so would I.<br>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet<br>sorrow<br>That I shall say <span class="quote" data-words="2">Good night</span> till it be morrow.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	850	850	1	2	Ay me.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	859	862	4	31	O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>Deny thy father and refuse thy name,<br>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	864	875	12	89	’Tis but thy name that is my enemy.<br>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,<br>Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name<br>Belonging to a man.<br>What’s in a name? That which we call a rose<br>By any other word would smell as sweet.<br>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,<br>Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br>And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,<br>Take all myself.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	879	880	2	14	What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,<br>So stumblest on my counsel?
JULIET-ROM	2	2	886	888	3	25	My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br>Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound.<br>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
JULIET-ROM	2	2	890	893	4	33	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br>And the place death, considering who thou art,<br>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	898	898	1	9	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	902	902	1	10	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	907	907	1	8	By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
JULIET-ROM	2	2	913	934	22	183	Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,<br>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.<br>Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny<br>What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.<br>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Ay,</span><br>And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,<br>Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,<br>They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br>Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br>I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,<br>So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.<br>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.<br>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true<br>Than those that have more coying to be strange.<br>I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>But that thou overheard’st ere I was ware<br>My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,<br>And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>Which the dark night hath so discoverèd.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	937	939	3	23	O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,<br>That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	941	944	4	25	Do not swear at all.<br>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br>Which is the god of my idolatry,<br>And I’ll believe thee.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	946	954	9	78	Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br>I have no joy of this contract tonight.<br>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,<br>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>Ere one can say <span class="quote" data-words="2">It lightens.</span> Sweet, good night.<br>This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,<br>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br>Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest<br>Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	956	956	1	6	What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
JULIET-ROM	2	2	958	959	2	18	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,<br>And yet I would it were to give again.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	961	968	8	72	But to be frank and give it thee again.<br>And yet I wish but for the thing I have.<br>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br>My love as deep. The more I give to thee,<br>The more I have, for both are infinite.<br>I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.—<br>Anon, good nurse.—Sweet Montague, be true.<br>Stay but a little; I will come again.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	972	978	7	58	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br>If that thy bent of love be honorable,<br>Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,<br>By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,<br>Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,<br>And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay<br>And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	980	981	2	13	I come anon.—But if thou meanest not well,<br>I do beseech thee—
JULIET-ROM	2	2	983	985	3	19	By and by, I come.—<br>To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.<br>Tomorrow will I send.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	987	987	1	5	A thousand times good night.
JULIET-ROM	2	2	992	997	6	45	Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice<br>To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br>Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,<br>Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies<br>And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine<br>With repetition of <span class="quote" data-words="2">My Romeo!</span>
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1349	1367	19	157	The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.<br>In half an hour she promised to return.<br>Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.<br>O, she is lame! Love’s heralds should be thoughts,<br>Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,<br>Driving back shadows over louring hills.<br>Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,<br>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br>Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve<br>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.<br>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<br>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br>And his to me.<br>But old folks, many feign as they were dead,<br>Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.<br>O God, she comes!—O, honey nurse, what news?<br>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1369	1373	5	37	Now, good sweet nurse—O Lord, why lookest thou<br>sad?<br>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.<br>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news<br>By playing it to me with so sour a face.
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1376	1378	3	20	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.<br>Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,<br>speak.
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1381	1387	7	62	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath<br>To say to me that thou art out of breath?<br>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay<br>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.<br>Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.<br>Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.<br>Let me be satisfied; is ’t good or bad?
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1397	1398	2	18	No, no. But all this did I know before.<br>What says he of our marriage? What of that?
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1404	1406	3	20	I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.<br>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my<br>love?
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1410	1412	4	27	Where is my mother? Why, she is within.<br>Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:<br><span class="quote" data-words="11">Your love says, like an honest gentleman,Where is your mother?</span>
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1418	1418	1	8	Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1420	1420	1	2	I have.
JULIET-ROM	2	5	1431	1431	1	7	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
JULIET-ROM	2	6	1452	1452	1	6	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
JULIET-ROM	2	6	1454	1454	1	10	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
JULIET-ROM	2	6	1461	1465	5	42	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,<br>Brags of his substance, not of ornament.<br>They are but beggars that can count their worth,<br>But my true love is grown to such excess<br>I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
JULIET-ROM	3	2	1676	1714	39	280	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br>Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a wagoner<br>As Phaëton would whip you to the west<br>And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br>That runaways’ eyes may wink, and Romeo<br>Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.<br>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br>By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,<br>It best agrees with night.

JULIET-ROM	3	2	1716	1716	1	10	Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?

JULIET-ROM	3	5	2068	2072	5	42	Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.<br>It is some meteor that the sun exhaled<br>To be to thee this night a torchbearer<br>And light thee on thy way to Mantua.<br>Therefore stay yet. Thou need’st not to be gone.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2082	2091	10	83	It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!<br>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br>Some say the lark makes sweet division.<br>This doth not so, for she divideth us.<br>Some say the lark and loathèd toad changed eyes.<br>O, now I would they had changed voices too,<br>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br>Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.<br>O, now begone. More light and light it grows.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2094	2094	1	1	Nurse?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2097	2097	1	9	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2099	2103	5	43	Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!<br>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<br>For in a minute there are many days.<br>O, by this count I shall be much in years<br>Ere I again behold my Romeo.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2107	2107	1	8	O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2110	2113	4	33	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br>Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,<br>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.<br>Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2116	2120	5	39	O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.<br>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him<br>That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,<br>For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,<br>But send him back.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2122	2124	3	26	Who is ’t that calls? It is my lady mother.<br>Is she not down so late or up so early?<br>What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2126	2126	1	5	Madam, I am not well.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2133	2133	1	9	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2136	2137	2	12	Feeling so the loss,<br>I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2140	2140	1	3	What villain, madam?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2142	2144	3	26	Villain and he be many miles asunder.—<br>God pardon him. I do with all my heart,<br>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2146	2147	2	18	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.<br>Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2154	2163	10	78	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied<br>With Romeo till I behold him—dead—<br>Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.<br>Madam, if you could find out but a man<br>To bear a poison, I would temper it,<br>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br>To hear him named and cannot come to him<br>To wreak the love I bore my cousin<br>Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2166	2167	2	15	And joy comes well in such a needy time.<br>What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2172	2172	1	8	Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2177	2184	8	71	Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,<br>He shall not make me there a joyful bride!<br>I wonder at this haste, that I must wed<br>Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.<br>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<br>I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear<br>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2207	2209	3	27	Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.<br>Proud can I never be of what I hate,<br>But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2220	2221	2	17	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2264	2269	6	48	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds<br>That sees into the bottom of my grief?—<br>O sweet my mother, cast me not away.<br>Delay this marriage for a month, a week,<br>Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br>In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2272	2280	9	68	O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br>My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.<br>How shall that faith return again to Earth<br>Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.—<br>Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems<br>Upon so soft a subject as myself.—<br>What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br>Some comfort, nurse.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2295	2295	1	5	Speak’st thou from thy heart?
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2297	2297	1	1	Amen.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2299	2302	4	30	Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.<br>Go in and tell my lady I am gone,<br>Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’ cell<br>To make confession and to be absolved.
JULIET-ROM	3	5	2304	2311	8	63	Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend!<br>Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn<br>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br>Which she hath praised him with above compare<br>So many thousand times? Go, counselor.<br>Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br>I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.<br>If all else fail, myself have power to die.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2330	2330	1	10	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2332	2332	1	5	What must be shall be.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2335	2335	1	8	To answer that, I should confess to you.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2337	2337	1	9	I will confess to you that I love him.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2339	2340	2	19	If I do so, it will be of more price<br>Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2342	2343	2	16	The tears have got small victory by that,<br>For it was bad enough before their spite.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2345	2346	2	19	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,<br>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2348	2350	3	26	It may be so, for it is not mine own.—<br>Are you at leisure, holy father, now,<br>Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2356	2357	2	20	O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,<br>Come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2362	2379	18	148	Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,<br>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br>If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,<br>Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br>And with this knife I’ll help it presently.<br>God joined my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;<br>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s sealed,<br>Shall be the label to another deed,<br>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br>Therefore out of thy long-experienced time<br>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<br>’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<br>Which the commission of thy years and art<br>Could to no issue of true honor bring.<br>Be not so long to speak. I long to die<br>If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2389	2401	13	100	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>From off the battlements of any tower,<br>Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br>Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,<br>Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,<br>O’ercovered quite with dead men’s rattling bones,<br>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.<br>Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud<br>(Things that to hear them told have made me<br>tremble),<br>And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2434	2434	1	10	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
JULIET-ROM	4	1	2438	2440	3	12	Love give me strength, and strength shall help<br>afford.<br>Farewell, dear father.
JULIET-ROM	4	2	2458	2463	6	43	Where I have learned me to repent the sin<br>Of disobedient opposition<br>To you and your behests, and am enjoined<br>By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here<br>To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.<br>Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
JULIET-ROM	4	2	2466	2468	3	23	I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell<br>And gave him what becomèd love I might,<br>Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
JULIET-ROM	4	2	2474	2476	3	24	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet<br>To help me sort such needful ornaments<br>As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
JULIET-ROM	4	3	2490	2494	5	42	Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,<br>I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,<br>For I have need of many orisons<br>To move the heavens to smile upon my state,<br>Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
JULIET-ROM	4	3	2496	2501	6	48	No, madam, we have culled such necessaries<br>As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.<br>So please you, let me now be left alone,<br>And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,<br>For I am sure you have your hands full all<br>In this so sudden business.
JULIET-ROM	4	3	2504	2549	46	372	Farewell.—God knows when we shall meet again.<br>I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins<br>That almost freezes up the heat of life.<br>I’ll call them back again to comfort me.—<br>Nurse!—What should she do here?<br>My dismal scene I needs must act alone.<br>Come, vial.<br>What if this mixture do not work at all?<br>Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?<br>No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.<br>What if it be a poison which the Friar<br>Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,<br>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored<br>Because he married me before to Romeo?<br>I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,<br>For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br>I wake before the time that Romeo<br>Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point.<br>Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,<br>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br>Or, if I live, is it not very like<br>The horrible conceit of death and night,<br>Together with the terror of the place—<br>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle<br>Where for this many hundred years the bones<br>Of all my buried ancestors are packed;<br>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>Lies fest’ring in his shroud; where, as they say,<br>At some hours in the night spirits resort—<br>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br>And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,<br>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad—<br>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br>Environèd with all these hideous fears,<br>And madly play with my forefathers’ joints,<br>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,<br>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,<br>As with a club, dash out my desp’rate brains?<br>O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost<br>Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body<br>Upon a rapier’s point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!<br>Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink. I drink to<br>thee.
JULIET-ROM	5	3	3006	3008	3	23	O comfortable friar, where is my lord?<br>I do remember well where I should be,<br>And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
JULIET-ROM	5	3	3018	3025	8	69	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.<br>What’s here? A cup closed in my true love’s hand?<br>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.—<br>O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br>To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.<br>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,<br>To make me die with a restorative.<br>Thy lips are warm!
JULIET-ROM	5	3	3027	3028	2	19	Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O, happy dagger,<br>This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.
LADY_CAPULET	1	1	91	92	2	10	A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a<br>sword?
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	370	370	1	9	Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	377	380	4	34	This is the matter.—Nurse, give leave awhile.<br>We must talk in secret.—Nurse, come back again.<br>I have remembered me, thou ’s hear our counsel.<br>Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	382	382	1	3	She’s not fourteen.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	386	386	1	5	A fortnight and odd days.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	423	423	1	9	Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	437	439	3	23	Marry, that <span class="quote" data-words="1">marry</span> is the very theme<br>I came to talk of.—Tell me, daughter Juliet,<br>How stands your disposition to be married?
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	444	449	6	47	Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you<br>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br>Are made already mothers. By my count<br>I was your mother much upon these years<br>That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:<br>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	452	452	1	7	Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	454	469	16	127	What say you? Can you love the gentleman?<br>This night you shall behold him at our feast.<br>Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,<br>And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.<br>Examine every married lineament<br>And see how one another lends content,<br>And what obscured in this fair volume lies<br>Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>To beautify him only lacks a cover.<br>The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride<br>For fair without the fair within to hide.<br>That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory<br>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.<br>So shall you share all that he doth possess<br>By having him, making yourself no less.
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	471	471	1	8	Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris’ love?
LADY_CAPULET	1	3	480	481	2	9	We follow thee.<br>Juliet, the County stays.
LADY_CAPULET	3	1	1622	1626	5	37	Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother’s child!<br>O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled<br>Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,<br>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.<br>O cousin, cousin!
LADY_CAPULET	3	1	1653	1658	6	49	He is a kinsman to the Montague.<br>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.<br>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br>And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.<br>Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
LADY_CAPULET	3	4	2029	2030	2	15	I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.<br>Tonight she’s mewed up to her heaviness.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2121	2121	1	5	Ho, daughter, are you up?
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2125	2125	1	4	Why, how now, Juliet?
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2127	2132	6	45	Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?<br>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.<br>Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of<br>love,<br>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2134	2135	2	14	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br>Which you weep for.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2138	2139	2	18	Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death<br>As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2141	2141	1	4	That same villain, Romeo.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2145	2145	1	7	That is because the traitor murderer lives.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2148	2153	6	48	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.<br>Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,<br>Where that same banished runagate doth live,<br>Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram<br>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.<br>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2164	2165	2	18	Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.<br>But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2168	2171	4	33	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,<br>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy<br>That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2173	2176	4	28	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn<br>The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,<br>The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church<br>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2185	2186	2	18	Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,<br>And see how he will take it at your hands.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2200	2201	2	19	Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br>I would the fool were married to her grave.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2219	2219	1	6	Fie, fie, what, are you mad?
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2242	2242	1	4	You are too hot.
LADY_CAPULET	3	5	2270	2271	2	20	Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.<br>Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
LADY_CAPULET	4	2	2477	2477	1	8	No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
LADY_CAPULET	4	2	2479	2480	2	11	We shall be short in our provision.<br>’Tis now near night.
LADY_CAPULET	4	3	2495	2495	1	9	What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
LADY_CAPULET	4	3	2502	2503	2	12	Good night.<br>Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
LADY_CAPULET	4	4	2550	2550	1	9	Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
LADY_CAPULET	4	4	2561	2562	2	18	Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,<br>But I will watch you from such watching now.
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2601	2601	1	4	What noise is here?
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2603	2603	1	4	What is the matter?
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2605	2607	3	22	O me! O me! My child, my only life,<br>Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.<br>Help, help! Call help.
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2610	2610	1	9	Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead.
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2617	2617	1	3	O woeful time!
LADY_CAPULET	4	5	2630	2635	6	44	Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!<br>Most miserable hour that e’er time saw<br>In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!<br>But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,<br>But one thing to rejoice and solace in,<br>And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
LADY_CAPULET	5	3	3051	3053	3	22	O, the people in the street cry <span class="quote" data-words="1">Romeo,</span><br>Some <span class="quote" data-words="1">Juliet,</span> and some <span class="quote" data-words="1">Paris,</span> and all run<br>With open outcry toward our monument.
LADY_CAPULET	5	3	3067	3068	2	18	O me, this sight of death is as a bell<br>That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
LADY_MONTAGUE	1	1	132	133	2	18	O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?<br>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
LADY_MONTAGUE	1	1	96	96	1	10	Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
MERCUTIO	1	4	495	495	1	8	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
MERCUTIO	1	4	499	500	2	15	You are a lover. Borrow Cupid’s wings<br>And soar with them above a common bound.
MERCUTIO	1	4	505	506	2	16	And to sink in it should you burden love—<br>Too great oppression for a tender thing.
MERCUTIO	1	4	509	514	6	51	If love be rough with you, be rough with love.<br>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.—<br>Give me a case to put my visage in.—<br>A visor for a visor. What care I<br>What curious eye doth cote deformities?<br>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
MERCUTIO	1	4	522	526	5	35	Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word.<br>If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire—<br>Or, save your reverence, love—wherein thou<br>stickest<br>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
MERCUTIO	1	4	528	531	4	33	I mean, sir, in delay<br>We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.<br>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<br>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
MERCUTIO	1	4	534	534	1	4	Why, may one ask?
MERCUTIO	1	4	536	536	1	4	And so did I.
MERCUTIO	1	4	538	538	1	4	That dreamers often lie.
MERCUTIO	1	4	540	582	43	329	O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes<br>In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br>On the forefinger of an alderman,<br>Drawn with a team of little atomi<br>Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.<br>Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,<br>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br>Her traces of the smallest spider web,<br>Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,<br>Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,<br>Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,<br>Not half so big as a round little worm<br>Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.<br>Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.<br>And in this state she gallops night by night<br>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br>On courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;<br>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues<br>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,<br>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.<br>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,<br>Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep;<br>Then he dreams of another benefice.<br>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,<br>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon<br>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes<br>And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>That plats the manes of horses in the night<br>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.<br>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>Making them women of good carriage.<br>This is she—
MERCUTIO	1	4	585	592	8	58	True, I talk of dreams,<br>Which are the children of an idle brain,<br>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<br>Which is as thin of substance as the air<br>And more inconstant than the wind, who woos<br>Even now the frozen bosom of the north<br>And, being angered, puffs away from thence,<br>Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
MERCUTIO	2	1	781	782	2	13	He is wise<br>And, on my life, hath stol’n him home to bed.
MERCUTIO	2	1	785	801	17	122	Nay, I’ll conjure too.<br>Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!<br>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.<br>Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied.<br>Cry but <span class="quote" data-words="2">Ay me,</span> pronounce but <span class="quote" data-words="1">love</span> and<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">dove.</span><br>Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br>One nickname for her purblind son and heir,<br>Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim<br>When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.—<br>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.<br>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.—<br>I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,<br>By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,<br>By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,<br>And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,<br>That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
MERCUTIO	2	1	803	809	7	54	This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him<br>To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle<br>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br>Till she had laid it and conjured it down.<br>That were some spite. My invocation<br>Is fair and honest. In his mistress’ name,<br>I conjure only but to raise up him.
MERCUTIO	2	1	813	821	9	70	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br>Now will he sit under a medlar tree<br>And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br>As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.—<br>O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were<br>An open-arse, thou a pop’rin pear.<br>Romeo, good night.

MERCUTIO	2	4	1133	1135	3	17	Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that<br>Rosaline,<br>Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1138	1138	1	5	A challenge, on my life.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1140	1140	1	9	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1143	1147	5	42	Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,<br>stabbed with a white wench’s black eye, run<br>through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his<br>heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt shaft. And<br>is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
MERCUTIO	2	4	1149	1156	8	69	More than prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous<br>captain of compliments. He fights as you sing<br>prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.<br>He rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in<br>your bosom—the very butcher of a silk button, a<br>duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house<br>of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal<br><span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="it">passado</span>, the <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="it">punto reverso</span>, the <span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="it">hay</span>!
MERCUTIO	2	4	1158	1164	9	72	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting<br>phantasimes, these new tuners of accent: <span class="quote" data-words="14">ByJesu, a very good blade! A very tall man!

MERCUTIO	2	4	1168	1176	9	83	Without his roe, like a dried herring. O<br>flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the<br>numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady<br>was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love<br>to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,<br>Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray<br>eye or so, but not to the purpose.—Signior Romeo,<br><span class="foreign" data-words="1" data-lang="fr">bonjour</span>. There’s a French salutation to your French<br>slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1179	1179	1	9	The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
MERCUTIO	2	4	1183	1184	2	19	That’s as much as to say such a case as<br>yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1186	1186	1	6	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1188	1188	1	8	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1190	1190	1	1	Right.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1192	1195	4	32	Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou<br>hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole<br>of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,<br>solely singular.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1198	1199	2	8	Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits<br>faints.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1202	1205	4	42	Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I<br>am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in<br>one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole<br>five. Was I with you there for the goose?
MERCUTIO	2	4	1208	1208	1	10	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1210	1211	2	13	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most<br>sharp sauce.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1214	1215	2	16	O, here’s a wit of cheveril that stretches<br>from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1219	1224	6	53	Why, is not this better now than groaning<br>for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou<br>Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as<br>by nature. For this driveling love is like a great<br>natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his<br>bauble in a hole.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1226	1227	2	11	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against<br>the hair.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1229	1232	4	30	O, thou art deceived. I would have made it<br>short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale<br>and meant indeed to occupy the argument no<br>longer.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1234	1234	1	7	Two, two—a shirt and a smock.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1238	1239	2	12	Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan’s<br>the fairer face.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1241	1241	1	6	God you good e’en, fair gentlewoman.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1243	1244	2	20	’Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of<br>the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1256	1257	2	12	Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’<br>faith, wisely, wisely.
MERCUTIO	2	4	1261	1261	1	8	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!

MERCUTIO	2	4	1274	1275	2	7	Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, lady, lady,<br>lady.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1473	1477	6	51	Thou art like one of these fellows that, when<br>he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his<br>sword upon the table and says <span class="quote" data-words="7">God send me noneed of thee</span> and, by the operation of the second<br>cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is<br>no need.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1480	1482	3	29	Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy<br>mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be<br>moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1484	1499	16	156	Nay, an there were two such, we should<br>have none shortly, for one would kill the other.<br>Thou—why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that<br>hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than<br>thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking<br>nuts, having no other reason but because thou<br>hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy<br>out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as<br>an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been<br>beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast<br>quarreled with a man for coughing in the street<br>because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain<br>asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor<br>for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With<br>another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?<br>And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
MERCUTIO	3	1	1503	1503	1	5	The fee simple? O simple!
MERCUTIO	3	1	1505	1505	1	6	By my heel, I care not.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1508	1509	2	19	And but one word with one of us? Couple it<br>with something. Make it a word and a blow.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1512	1513	2	8	Could you not take some occasion without<br>giving?
MERCUTIO	3	1	1515	1518	4	30	Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?<br>An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear<br>nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick; here’s<br>that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
MERCUTIO	3	1	1523	1524	2	19	Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.<br>I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1526	1528	3	28	But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.<br>Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.<br>Your Worship in that sense may call him <span class="quote" data-words="1">man.</span>

MERCUTIO	3	1	1546	1551	6	55	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your<br>nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as<br>you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the<br>eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher<br>by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your<br>ears ere it be out.

MERCUTIO	3	1	1568	1576	9	87	No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as<br>a church door, but ’tis enough. ’Twill serve. Ask for<br>me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I<br>am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’<br>both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a<br>cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a<br>villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the<br>devil came you between us? I was hurt under your<br>arm.
MERCUTIO	3	1	1578	1581	4	31	Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br>Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses!<br>They have made worms’ meat of me.<br>I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!

ROMEO	1	4	583	584	2	8	Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.<br>Thou talk’st of nothing.
ROMEO	1	4	595	602	8	59	I fear too early, for my mind misgives<br>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars<br>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br>With this night’s revels, and expire the term<br>Of a despisèd life closed in my breast<br>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br>But he that hath the steerage of my course<br>Direct my sail.

ROMEO	2	2	1008	1008	1	8	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
ROMEO	2	2	1011	1012	2	15	And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br>Forgetting any other home but this.
ROMEO	2	2	1019	1019	1	6	I would I were thy bird.
ROMEO	2	2	1025	1028	4	38	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.<br>Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.<br>Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell,<br>His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
ROMEO	2	2	824	849	26	216	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.<br>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?<br>It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.<br>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>Who is already sick and pale with grief<br>That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.<br>Be not her maid since she is envious.<br>Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br>And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.<br>It is my lady. O, it is my love!<br>O, that she knew she were!<br>She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br>I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks.<br>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br>Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>The brightness of her cheek would shame those<br>stars<br>As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven<br>Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.<br>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>That I might touch that cheek!
ROMEO	2	2	851	858	8	55	She speaks.<br>O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art<br>As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,<br>As is a wingèd messenger of heaven<br>Unto the white-upturnèd wond’ring eyes<br>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br>When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds<br>And sails upon the bosom of the air.
ROMEO	2	2	863	863	1	10	Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
ROMEO	2	2	876	878	3	21	I take thee at thy word.<br>Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized.<br>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
ROMEO	2	2	881	885	5	37	By a name<br>I know not how to tell thee who I am.<br>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself<br>Because it is an enemy to thee.<br>Had I it written, I would tear the word.
ROMEO	2	2	889	889	1	7	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
ROMEO	2	2	894	897	4	33	With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,<br>For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br>And what love can do, that dares love attempt.<br>Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
ROMEO	2	2	899	901	3	24	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br>Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,<br>And I am proof against their enmity.
ROMEO	2	2	903	906	4	35	I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,<br>And, but thou love me, let them find me here.<br>My life were better ended by their hate<br>Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
ROMEO	2	2	908	912	5	42	By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.<br>He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br>As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,<br>I should adventure for such merchandise.
ROMEO	2	2	935	936	2	15	Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow,<br>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—
ROMEO	2	2	940	940	1	5	What shall I swear by?
ROMEO	2	2	945	945	1	5	If my heart’s dear love—
ROMEO	2	2	955	955	1	7	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
ROMEO	2	2	957	957	1	9	Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
ROMEO	2	2	960	960	1	8	Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
ROMEO	2	2	969	971	3	22	O blessèd, blessèd night! I am afeard,<br>Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br>Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
ROMEO	2	2	986	986	1	4	So thrive my soul—
ROMEO	2	2	988	991	4	27	A thousand times the worse to want thy light.<br>Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their<br>books,<br>But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
ROMEO	2	2	998	1000	3	22	It is my soul that calls upon my name.<br>How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,<br>Like softest music to attending ears.
ROMEO	2	3	1060	1060	1	3	Good morrow, father.
ROMEO	2	3	1074	1074	1	9	That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
ROMEO	2	3	1076	1077	2	15	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.<br>I have forgot that name and that name’s woe.
ROMEO	2	3	1080	1086	7	52	I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.<br>I have been feasting with mine enemy,<br>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me<br>That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies<br>Within thy help and holy physic lies.<br>I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo,<br>My intercession likewise steads my foe.
ROMEO	2	3	1089	1096	8	68	Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set<br>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.<br>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,<br>And all combined, save what thou must combine<br>By holy marriage. When and where and how<br>We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow<br>I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,<br>That thou consent to marry us today.
ROMEO	2	3	1114	1114	1	7	Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
ROMEO	2	3	1116	1116	1	5	And bad’st me bury love.
ROMEO	2	3	1119	1121	3	24	I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now<br>Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.<br>The other did not so.
ROMEO	2	3	1128	1128	1	9	O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.
ROMEO	2	4	1177	1178	2	11	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit<br>did I give you?
ROMEO	2	4	1180	1182	3	19	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was<br>great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain<br>courtesy.
ROMEO	2	4	1185	1185	1	3	Meaning, to curtsy.
ROMEO	2	4	1187	1187	1	4	A most courteous exposition.
ROMEO	2	4	1189	1189	1	3	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Pink</span> for flower.
ROMEO	2	4	1191	1191	1	7	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
ROMEO	2	4	1196	1197	2	8	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the<br>singleness.
ROMEO	2	4	1200	1201	2	11	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry<br>a match.
ROMEO	2	4	1206	1207	2	15	Thou wast never with me for anything when<br>thou wast not there for the goose.
ROMEO	2	4	1209	1209	1	5	Nay, good goose, bite not.
ROMEO	2	4	1212	1213	2	11	And is it not, then, well served into a sweet<br>goose?
ROMEO	2	4	1216	1218	3	21	I stretch it out for that word <span class="quote" data-words="1">broad,</span> which<br>added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a<br>broad goose.
ROMEO	2	4	1233	1233	1	7	Here’s goodly gear. A sail, a sail!
ROMEO	2	4	1246	1247	2	9	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself<br>to mar.
ROMEO	2	4	1251	1254	4	34	I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older<br>when you have found him than he was when you<br>sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for<br>fault of a worse.
ROMEO	2	4	1262	1262	1	4	What hast thou found?
ROMEO	2	4	1273	1273	1	4	I will follow you.
ROMEO	2	4	1278	1280	3	24	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself<br>talk and will speak more in a minute than he will<br>stand to in a month.
ROMEO	2	4	1304	1305	2	12	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.<br>I protest unto thee—
ROMEO	2	4	1308	1309	2	11	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not<br>mark me.
ROMEO	2	4	1312	1315	4	28	Bid her devise<br>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,<br>And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell<br>Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
ROMEO	2	4	1317	1317	1	6	Go to, I say you shall.
ROMEO	2	4	1319	1325	7	56	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.<br>Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,<br>Which to the high topgallant of my joy<br>Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br>Farewell. Be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains.<br>Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
ROMEO	2	4	1327	1327	1	6	What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
ROMEO	2	4	1330	1330	1	8	Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.
ROMEO	2	4	1340	1340	1	9	Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.
ROMEO	2	4	1345	1345	1	5	Commend me to thy lady.
ROMEO	2	6	1434	1439	6	48	Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,<br>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy<br>That one short minute gives me in her sight.<br>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,<br>Then love-devouring death do what he dare,<br>It is enough I may but call her mine.
ROMEO	2	6	1455	1460	6	47	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy<br>Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more<br>To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath<br>This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue<br>Unfold the imagined happiness that both<br>Receive in either by this dear encounter.
ROMEO	3	1	1531	1534	4	31	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br>To such a greeting. Villain am I none.<br>Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
ROMEO	3	1	1537	1541	5	39	I do protest I never injured thee<br>But love thee better than thou canst devise<br>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.<br>And so, good Capulet, which name I tender<br>As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
ROMEO	3	1	1553	1553	1	6	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
ROMEO	3	1	1555	1559	5	30	Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.<br>Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!<br>Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath<br>Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.<br>Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
ROMEO	3	1	1567	1567	1	7	Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.
ROMEO	3	1	1577	1577	1	6	I thought all for the best.
ROMEO	3	1	1582	1588	7	47	This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,<br>My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt<br>In my behalf. My reputation stained<br>With Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, that an hour<br>Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,<br>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate<br>And in my temper softened valor’s steel.
ROMEO	3	1	1592	1593	2	17	This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.<br>This but begins the woe others must end.
ROMEO	3	1	1595	1602	8	58	Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!<br>Away to heaven, respective lenity,<br>And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.—<br>Now, Tybalt, take the <span class="quote" data-words="1">villain</span> back again<br>That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio’s soul<br>Is but a little way above our heads,<br>Staying for thine to keep him company.<br>Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
ROMEO	3	1	1605	1605	1	4	This shall determine that.
ROMEO	3	1	1610	1610	1	5	O, I am Fortune’s fool!
ROMEO	3	3	1836	1838	3	20	Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?<br>What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand<br>That I yet know not?
ROMEO	3	3	1842	1842	1	8	What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
ROMEO	3	3	1845	1847	3	22	Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say <span class="quote" data-words="1">death,</span><br>For exile hath more terror in his look,<br>Much more than death. Do not say <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishment.</span>
ROMEO	3	3	1850	1856	7	49	There is no world without Verona walls<br>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>Hence <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd</span> is <span class="quote" data-words="4">banished from the world,</span><br>And world’s exile is death. Then <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd</span><br>Is death mistermed. Calling death <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd,</span><br>Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax<br>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
ROMEO	3	3	1863	1886	24	175	’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here<br>Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog<br>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>Live here in heaven and may look on her,<br>But Romeo may not. More validity,<br>More honorable state, more courtship lives<br>In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br>On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand<br>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>Who even in pure and vestal modesty<br>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>But Romeo may not; he is banishèd.<br>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.<br>They are free men, but I am banishèd.<br>And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?<br>Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground<br>knife,<br>No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,<br>But <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd</span> to kill me? <span class="quote" data-words="1">Banishèd</span>?<br>O friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.<br>Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,<br>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>A sin absolver, and my friend professed,<br>To mangle me with that word <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd</span>?
ROMEO	3	3	1888	1888	1	7	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
ROMEO	3	3	1892	1895	4	27	Yet <span class="quote" data-words="1">banishèd</span>? Hang up philosophy.<br>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br>Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,<br>It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
ROMEO	3	3	1897	1897	1	10	How should they when that wise men have no eyes?
ROMEO	3	3	1899	1906	8	62	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.<br>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br>An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd,<br>Doting like me, and like me banishèd,<br>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy<br>hair<br>And fall upon the ground as I do now,<br>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
ROMEO	3	3	1908	1909	2	16	Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,<br>Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.
ROMEO	3	3	1931	1931	1	1	Nurse.
ROMEO	3	3	1933	1938	6	51	Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?<br>Doth not she think me an old murderer,<br>Now I have stained the childhood of our joy<br>With blood removed but little from her own?<br>Where is she? And how doth she? And what says<br>My concealed lady to our canceled love?
ROMEO	3	3	1943	1949	7	49	As if that name,<br>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br>Did murder her, as that name’s cursèd hand<br>Murdered her kinsman.—O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br>In what vile part of this anatomy<br>Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack<br>The hateful mansion.
ROMEO	3	3	2004	2004	1	9	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
ROMEO	3	3	2007	2007	1	8	How well my comfort is revived by this!
ROMEO	3	3	2016	2018	3	21	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,<br>It were a grief so brief to part with thee.<br>Farewell.
ROMEO	3	5	2062	2067	6	48	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<br>No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks<br>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.<br>Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.<br>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
ROMEO	3	5	2073	2081	9	83	Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death.<br>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br>I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye;<br>’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.<br>Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat<br>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<br>I have more care to stay than will to go.<br>Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.<br>How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.
ROMEO	3	5	2092	2092	1	10	More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
ROMEO	3	5	2098	2098	1	7	Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend.
ROMEO	3	5	2104	2106	3	14	Farewell.<br>I will omit no opportunity<br>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
ROMEO	3	5	2108	2109	2	18	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve<br>For sweet discourses in our times to come.
ROMEO	3	5	2114	2115	2	17	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.<br>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.
ROMEO	5	1	2733	2749	17	139	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,<br>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.<br>My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne,<br>And all this day an unaccustomed spirit<br>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.<br>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead<br>(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to<br>think!)<br>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips<br>That I revived and was an emperor.<br>Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed<br>When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!<br>News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar?<br>Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?<br>How doth my lady? Is my father well?<br>How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,<br>For nothing can be ill if she be well.
ROMEO	5	1	2757	2759	3	25	Is it e’en so?—Then I deny you, stars!—<br>Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,<br>And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
ROMEO	5	1	2763	2765	3	23	Tush, thou art deceived.<br>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.<br>Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
ROMEO	5	1	2767	2790	26	193	No matter. Get thee gone,<br>And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.<br>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.<br>Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift<br>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.<br>I do remember an apothecary<br>(And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted<br>In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br>Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.<br>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.<br>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br>An alligator stuffed, and other skins<br>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,<br>A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br>Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,<br>Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses<br>Were thinly scattered to make up a show.<br>Noting this penury, to myself I said<br><span class="quote" data-words="25">An if a man did need a poison now,Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.</span><br>O, this same thought did but forerun my need,<br>And this same needy man must sell it me.<br>As I remember, this should be the house.<br>Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.—<br>What ho, Apothecary!
ROMEO	5	1	2794	2801	8	64	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.<br>Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have<br>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br>As will disperse itself through all the veins,<br>That the life-weary taker may fall dead,<br>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath<br>As violently as hasty powder fired<br>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
ROMEO	5	1	2804	2810	7	60	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<br>And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,<br>Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,<br>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.<br>The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.<br>The world affords no law to make thee rich.<br>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
ROMEO	5	1	2812	2812	1	8	I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
ROMEO	5	1	2816	2823	8	61	There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,<br>Doing more murder in this loathsome world<br>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not<br>sell.<br>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br>Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br>To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
ROMEO	5	3	2875	2892	18	143	Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.<br>Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning<br>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.<br>Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,<br>Whate’er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof<br>And do not interrupt me in my course.<br>Why I descend into this bed of death<br>Is partly to behold my lady’s face,<br>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br>A precious ring, a ring that I must use<br>In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.<br>But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<br>In what I farther shall intend to do,<br>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<br>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.<br>The time and my intents are savage-wild,<br>More fierce and more inexorable far<br>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
ROMEO	5	3	2894	2895	2	19	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.<br>Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
ROMEO	5	3	2898	2901	4	32	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,<br>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,<br>Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,<br>And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food.
ROMEO	5	3	2911	2920	10	76	I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.<br>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man.<br>Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.<br>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,<br>Put not another sin upon my head<br>By urging me to fury. O, begone!<br>By heaven, I love thee better than myself,<br>For I come hither armed against myself.<br>Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say<br>A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
ROMEO	5	3	2923	2923	1	9	Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
ROMEO	5	3	2927	2973	47	390	In faith, I will.—Let me peruse this face.<br>Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!<br>What said my man when my betossèd soul<br>Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br>He told me Paris should have married Juliet.<br>Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?<br>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br>To think it was so?—O, give me thy hand,<br>One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book!<br>I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.—<br>A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,<br>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br>This vault a feasting presence full of light.—<br>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.<br>How oft when men are at the point of death<br>Have they been merry, which their keepers call<br>A light’ning before death! O, how may I<br>Call this a light’ning?—O my love, my wife,<br>Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,<br>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br>Thou art not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet<br>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br>And death’s pale flag is not advancèd there.—<br>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br>O, what more favor can I do to thee<br>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br>To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>Forgive me, cousin.—Ah, dear Juliet,<br>Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe<br>That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps<br>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>For fear of that I still will stay with thee<br>And never from this palace of dim night<br>Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br>With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br>Will I set up my everlasting rest<br>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.<br>Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you<br>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>A dateless bargain to engrossing death.<br>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!<br>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!<br>Here’s to my love. O true apothecary,<br>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
SAMPSON	1	1	15	15	1	8	Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals.
SAMPSON	1	1	17	17	1	9	I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
SAMPSON	1	1	20	20	1	5	I strike quickly, being moved.
SAMPSON	1	1	22	22	1	9	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
SAMPSON	1	1	26	27	2	22	A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I<br>will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
SAMPSON	1	1	30	33	4	31	’Tis true, and therefore women, being the<br>weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore<br>I will push Montague’s men from the wall and<br>thrust his maids to the wall.
SAMPSON	1	1	36	38	3	29	’Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.<br>When I have fought with the men, I will be civil<br>with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
SAMPSON	1	1	40	41	2	16	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.<br>Take it in what sense thou wilt.
SAMPSON	1	1	43	44	2	20	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,<br>and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
SAMPSON	1	1	48	49	2	10	My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back<br>thee.
SAMPSON	1	1	51	51	1	3	Fear me not.
SAMPSON	1	1	53	54	2	11	Let us take the law of our sides; let them<br>begin.
SAMPSON	1	1	57	58	2	20	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at<br>them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.
SAMPSON	1	1	60	60	1	6	I do bite my thumb, sir.
SAMPSON	1	1	62	63	2	10	Is the law of our side if I<br>say <span class="quote" data-words="1">Ay</span>?
SAMPSON	1	1	65	66	2	17	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,<br>but I bite my thumb, sir.
SAMPSON	1	1	69	70	2	17	But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as<br>good a man as you.
SAMPSON	1	1	72	72	1	2	Well, sir.
SAMPSON	1	1	75	75	1	3	Yes, better, sir.
SAMPSON	1	1	77	78	2	10	Draw if you be men.—Gregory, remember<br>thy washing blow.
SECOND_MUSICIAN	4	5	2708	2709	2	11	Pray you, put up your dagger and<br>put out your wit.
SECOND_MUSICIAN	4	5	2721	2722	2	9	I say <span class="quote" data-words="2">silver sound</span> because musicians<br>sound for silver.
SECOND_MUSICIAN	4	5	2731	2732	2	14	Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in<br>here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
SECOND_SERVINGMAN	1	5	607	609	3	20	When good manners shall lie<br>all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed<br>too, ’tis a foul thing.
SECOND_SERVINGMAN	4	4	2570	2571	2	17	I have a head, sir, that will find out logs<br>And never trouble Peter for the matter.
THIRD_MUSICIAN	4	5	2724	2724	1	7	Faith, I know not what to say.
THIRD_SERVINGMAN	1	5	615	615	1	3	Ay, boy, ready.
THIRD_SERVINGMAN	1	5	618	620	3	18	We cannot be here and there too.<br>Cheerly, boys! Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver<br>take all.
TYBALT	1	1	81	82	2	15	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.
TYBALT	1	1	85	87	3	22	What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word<br>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.<br>Have at thee, coward!
TYBALT	1	5	664	670	7	52	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—<br>Fetch me my rapier, boy.<br>What, dares the slave<br>Come hither covered with an antic face<br>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?<br>Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,<br>To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
TYBALT	1	5	672	674	3	22	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,<br>A villain that is hither come in spite<br>To scorn at our solemnity this night.
TYBALT	1	5	676	676	1	5	’Tis he, that villain Romeo.
TYBALT	1	5	687	688	2	13	It fits when such a villain is a guest.<br>I’ll not endure him.
TYBALT	1	5	695	695	1	5	Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
TYBALT	1	5	703	706	4	28	Patience perforce with willful choler meeting<br>Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.<br>I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,<br>Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall.
TYBALT	3	1	1506	1507	2	18	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.—<br>Gentlemen, good e’en. A word with one of you.
TYBALT	3	1	1510	1511	2	15	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an<br>you will give me occasion.
TYBALT	3	1	1514	1514	1	5	Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
TYBALT	3	1	1525	1525	1	10	Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
TYBALT	3	1	1529	1530	2	17	Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford<br>No better term than this: thou art a villain.
TYBALT	3	1	1535	1536	2	16	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<br>That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.
TYBALT	3	1	1545	1545	1	6	What wouldst thou have with me?
TYBALT	3	1	1552	1552	1	4	I am for you.
TYBALT	3	1	1603	1604	2	12	Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here<br>Shalt with him hence.
