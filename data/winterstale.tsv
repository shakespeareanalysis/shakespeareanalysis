	1	1	1	4	4	34	If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia<br>on the like occasion whereon my services<br>are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<br>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
	1	1	10	10	1	2	Beseech you—
	1	1	11	16	6	47	Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my<br>knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in<br>so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you<br>sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our<br>insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as<br>little accuse us.
	1	1	17	18	2	11	You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given<br>freely.
	1	1	19	21	3	17	Believe me, I speak as my understanding<br>instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to<br>utterance.
	1	1	22	33	12	89	Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<br>They were trained together in their childhoods,<br>and there rooted betwixt them then such an<br>affection which cannot choose but branch now.<br>Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities<br>made separation of their society, their encounters,<br>though not personal, hath been royally<br>attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<br>embassies, that they have seemed to be together<br>though absent, shook hands as over a vast, and<br>embraced as it were from the ends of opposed<br>winds. The heavens continue their loves.
	1	1	34	38	5	39	I think there is not in the world either<br>malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable<br>comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a<br>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came<br>into my note.
	1	1	39	43	5	44	I very well agree with you in the hopes of<br>him. It is a gallant child—one that indeed physics<br>the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went<br>on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to<br>see him a man.
	1	1	44	44	1	7	Would they else be content to die?
	1	1	45	46	2	13	Yes, if there were no other excuse why they<br>should desire to live.
	1	1	47	48	2	17	If the King had no son, they would desire<br>to live on crutches till he had one.
	1	1	5	7	3	20	I think this coming summer the King of<br>Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which<br>he justly owes him.
	1	1	8	9	2	15	Wherein our entertainment shall shame<br>us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed—
	1	2	104	104	1	2	No, madam.
	1	2	105	105	1	4	Nay, but you will?
	1	2	106	106	1	4	I may not, verily.
	1	2	107	118	12	87	Verily?<br>You put me off with limber vows. But I,<br>Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with<br>oaths,<br>Should yet say <span class="quote" data-words="3">Sir, no going.</span> Verily,<br>You shall not go. A lady’s <span class="quote" data-words="1">verily</span> is<br>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?<br>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,<br>Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees<br>When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?<br>My prisoner or my guest? By your dread <span class="quote" data-words="1">verily,</span><br>One of them you shall be.
	1	2	119	122	4	23	Your guest, then, madam.<br>To be your prisoner should import offending,<br>Which is for me less easy to commit<br>Than you to punish.
	1	2	123	126	4	27	Not your jailer, then,<br>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you<br>Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.<br>You were pretty lordings then?
	1	2	127	130	4	25	We were, fair queen,<br>Two lads that thought there was no more behind<br>But such a day tomorrow as today,<br>And to be boy eternal.
	1	2	131	132	2	10	Was not my lord<br>The verier wag o’ th’ two?
	1	2	133	142	10	66	We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun<br>And bleat the one at th’ other. What we changed<br>Was innocence for innocence. We knew not<br>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed<br>That any did. Had we pursued that life,<br>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared<br>With stronger blood, we should have answered<br>heaven<br>Boldly <span class="quote" data-words="2">Not guilty,</span> the imposition cleared<br>Hereditary ours.
	1	2	143	144	2	8	By this we gather<br>You have tripped since.
	1	2	145	149	5	36	O my most sacred lady,<br>Temptations have since then been born to ’s, for<br>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;<br>Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes<br>Of my young playfellow.
	1	2	150	156	7	53	Grace to boot!<br>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say<br>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.<br>Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,<br>If you first sinned with us, and that with us<br>You did continue fault, and that you slipped not<br>With any but with us.
	1	2	157	157	1	4	Is he won yet?
	1	2	158	158	1	4	He’ll stay, my lord.
	1	2	159	161	3	15	At my request he would not.<br>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st<br>To better purpose.
	1	2	162	162	1	1	Never?
	1	2	163	163	1	3	Never but once.
	1	2	164	176	13	108	What, have I twice said well? When was ’t before?<br>I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s<br>As fat as tame things. One good deed dying<br>tongueless<br>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.<br>Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s<br>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere<br>With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:<br>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.<br>What was my first? It has an elder sister,<br>Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!<br>But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?<br>Nay, let me have ’t; I long.
	1	2	177	182	6	34	Why, that was when<br>Three crabbèd months had soured themselves to<br>death<br>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand<br>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">I am yours forever.</span>
	1	2	183	186	4	28	’Tis grace indeed.<br>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.<br>The one forever earned a royal husband,<br>Th’ other for some while a friend.
	1	2	187	199	13	100	Too hot, too hot!<br>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.<br>I have <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">tremor cordis</span> on me. My heart dances,<br>But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment<br>May a free face put on, derive a liberty<br>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,<br>And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.<br>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,<br>As now they are, and making practiced smiles<br>As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere<br>The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment<br>My bosom likes not, nor my brows.—Mamillius,<br>Art thou my boy?
	1	2	200	200	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
	1	2	201	209	9	58	I’ fecks!<br>Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy<br>nose?<br>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,<br>We must be neat—not neat, but cleanly, captain.<br>And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf<br>Are all called neat.—Still virginalling<br>Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf?<br>Art thou my calf?
	1	2	210	210	1	6	Yes, if you will, my lord.
	1	2	211	231	21	157	Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I<br>have<br>To be full like me; yet they say we are<br>Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,<br>That will say anything. But were they false<br>As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false<br>As dice are to be wished by one that fixes<br>No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true<br>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,<br>Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,<br>Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?—may ’t<br>be?—<br>Affection, thy intention stabs the center.<br>Thou dost make possible things not so held,<br>Communicat’st with dreams—how can this be?<br>With what’s unreal thou coactive art,<br>And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent<br>Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,<br>And that beyond commission, and I find it,<br>And that to the infection of my brains<br>And hard’ning of my brows.
	1	2	232	232	1	3	What means Sicilia?
	1	2	233	233	1	4	He something seems unsettled.
	1	2	234	234	1	3	How, my lord?
	1	2	235	235	1	9	What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother?
	1	2	236	238	3	16	You look<br>As if you held a brow of much distraction.<br>Are you moved, my lord?
	1	2	239	250	12	84	No, in good earnest.<br>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,<br>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime<br>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines<br>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil<br>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,<br>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled<br>Lest it should bite its master and so prove,<br>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.<br>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,<br>This squash, this gentleman.—Mine honest friend,<br>Will you take eggs for money?
	1	2	251	251	1	5	No, my lord, I’ll fight.
	1	2	252	254	3	26	You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!—My brother,<br>Are you so fond of your young prince as we<br>Do seem to be of ours?
	1	2	255	261	7	48	If at home, sir,<br>He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,<br>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,<br>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.<br>He makes a July’s day short as December,<br>And with his varying childness cures in me<br>Thoughts that would thick my blood.
	1	2	262	269	8	50	So stands this<br>squire<br>Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,<br>And leave you to your graver steps.—Hermione,<br>How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome.<br>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.<br>Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s<br>Apparent to my heart.
	1	2	270	271	2	16	If you would seek us,<br>We are yours i’ th’ garden. Shall ’s attend you there?
	1	2	272	304	33	258	To your own bents dispose you. You’ll be found,<br>Be you beneath the sky. I am angling now,<br>Though you perceive me not how I give line.<br>Go to, go to!<br>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him,<br>And arms her with the boldness of a wife<br>To her allowing husband!<br>Gone already.<br>Inch thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked<br>one!—<br>Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I<br>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue<br>Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor<br>Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.—There have<br>been,<br>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;<br>And many a man there is, even at this present,<br>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,<br>That little thinks she has been sluiced in ’s absence,<br>And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by<br>Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t<br>Whiles other men have gates and those gates<br>opened,<br>As mine, against their will. Should all despair<br>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind<br>Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there’s none.<br>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike<br>Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,<br>From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,<br>No barricado for a belly. Know ’t,<br>It will let in and out the enemy<br>With bag and baggage. Many thousand on ’s<br>Have the disease and feel ’t not.—How now, boy?
	1	2	305	305	1	6	I am like you, they say.
	1	2	306	307	2	7	Why, that’s some comfort.—<br>What, Camillo there?
	1	2	308	308	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
	1	2	309	310	2	18	Go play, Mamillius. Thou ’rt an honest man.<br>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
	1	2	311	312	2	17	You had much ado to make his anchor hold.<br>When you cast out, it still came home.
	1	2	313	313	1	3	Didst note it?
	1	2	314	315	2	12	He would not stay at your petitions, made<br>His business more material.
	1	2	316	321	6	32	Didst perceive it?<br>They’re here with me already, whisp’ring,<br>rounding:<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Sicilia is a so-forth.</span> ’Tis far gone<br>When I shall gust it last.—How came ’t, Camillo,<br>That he did stay?
	1	2	322	322	1	5	At the good queen’s entreaty.
	1	2	323	330	8	62	<span class="quote" data-words="3">At the queen’s</span> be ’t. <span class="quote" data-words="1">Good</span> should be pertinent,<br>But so it is, it is not. Was this taken<br>By any understanding pate but thine?<br>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in<br>More than the common blocks. Not noted, is ’t,<br>But of the finer natures, by some severals<br>Of headpiece extraordinary? Lower messes<br>Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.
	1	2	331	332	2	11	Business, my lord? I think most understand<br>Bohemia stays here longer.
	1	2	333	333	1	1	Ha?
	1	2	334	334	1	3	Stays here longer.
	1	2	335	335	1	3	Ay, but why?
	1	2	336	337	2	12	To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties<br>Of our most gracious mistress.
	1	2	338	346	9	55	Satisfy?<br>Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?<br>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,<br>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well<br>My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou<br>Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed<br>Thy penitent reformed. But we have been<br>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived<br>In that which seems so.
	1	2	347	347	1	5	Be it forbid, my lord!
	1	2	348	357	10	62	To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,<br>If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,<br>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining<br>From course required; or else thou must be<br>counted<br>A servant grafted in my serious trust<br>And therein negligent; or else a fool<br>That seest a game played home, the rich stake<br>drawn,<br>And tak’st it all for jest.
	1	2	358	376	19	133	My gracious lord,<br>I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful.<br>In every one of these no man is free,<br>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,<br>Among the infinite doings of the world,<br>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,<br>If ever I were willful-negligent,<br>It was my folly; if industriously<br>I played the fool, it was my negligence,<br>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful<br>To do a thing where I the issue doubted,<br>Whereof the execution did cry out<br>Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear<br>Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,<br>Are such allowed infirmities that honesty<br>Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,<br>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass<br>By its own visage. If I then deny it,<br>’Tis none of mine.
	1	2	377	388	12	91	Ha’ not you seen, Camillo—<br>But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass<br>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn—or heard—<br>For to a vision so apparent, rumor<br>Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation<br>Resides not in that man that does not think—<br>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess—<br>Or else be impudently negative<br>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought—then say<br>My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name<br>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to<br>Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.
	1	2	389	394	6	42	I would not be a stander-by to hear<br>My sovereign mistress clouded so without<br>My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,<br>You never spoke what did become you less<br>Than this, which to reiterate were sin<br>As deep as that, though true.
	1	2	395	407	13	96	Is whispering nothing?<br>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?<br>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career<br>Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible<br>Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?<br>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?<br>Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes<br>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,<br>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?<br>Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing,<br>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,<br>My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,<br>If this be nothing.
	1	2	408	410	3	15	Good my lord, be cured<br>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,<br>For ’tis most dangerous.
	1	2	411	411	1	5	Say it be, ’tis true.
	1	2	412	412	1	4	No, no, my lord.
	1	2	413	420	8	60	It is. You lie, you lie.<br>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,<br>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,<br>Or else a hovering temporizer that<br>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,<br>Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver<br>Infected as her life, she would not live<br>The running of one glass.
	1	2	421	421	1	4	Who does infect her?
	1	2	422	433	12	94	Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging<br>About his neck—Bohemia, who, if I<br>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes<br>To see alike mine honor as their profits,<br>Their own particular thrifts, they would do that<br>Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,<br>His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form<br>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see<br>Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven<br>How I am galled—mightst bespice a cup<br>To give mine enemy a lasting wink,<br>Which draft to me were cordial.
	1	2	434	439	6	45	Sir, my lord,<br>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,<br>But with a ling’ring dram that should not work<br>Maliciously like poison. But I cannot<br>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,<br>So sovereignly being honorable. I have loved thee—
	1	2	440	449	10	77	Make that thy question, and go rot!<br>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,<br>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully<br>The purity and whiteness of my sheets—<br>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted<br>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps—<br>Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince, my son,<br>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,<br>Without ripe moving to ’t? Would I do this?<br>Could man so blench?
	1	2	450	456	7	52	I must believe you, sir.<br>I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for ’t—<br>Provided that, when he’s removed, your Highness<br>Will take again your queen as yours at first,<br>Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing<br>The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms<br>Known and allied to yours.
	1	2	457	459	3	22	Thou dost advise me<br>Even so as I mine own course have set down.<br>I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.
	1	2	460	465	6	38	My lord,<br>Go then, and with a countenance as clear<br>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia<br>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.<br>If from me he have wholesome beverage,<br>Account me not your servant.
	1	2	466	468	3	21	This is all.<br>Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;<br>Do ’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.
	1	2	469	469	1	5	I’ll do ’t, my lord.
	1	2	470	470	1	9	I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
	1	2	471	484	14	109	O miserable lady! But, for me,<br>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner<br>Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t<br>Is the obedience to a master, one<br>Who in rebellion with himself will have<br>All that are his so too. To do this deed,<br>Promotion follows. If I could find example<br>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings<br>And flourished after, I’d not do ’t. But since<br>Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears not one,<br>Let villainy itself forswear ’t. I must<br>Forsake the court. To do ’t or no is certain<br>To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!<br>Here comes Bohemia.
	1	2	485	487	3	15	This is strange. Methinks<br>My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?—<br>Good day, Camillo.
	1	2	488	488	1	4	Hail, most royal sir.
	1	2	489	489	1	7	What is the news i’ th’ court?
	1	2	49	57	9	67	Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been<br>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne<br>Without a burden. Time as long again<br>Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,<br>And yet we should for perpetuity<br>Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,<br>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply<br>With one <span class="quote" data-words="3">We thank you</span> many thousands more<br>That go before it.
	1	2	490	490	1	4	None rare, my lord.
	1	2	491	498	8	62	The King hath on him such a countenance<br>As he had lost some province and a region<br>Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him<br>With customary compliment, when he,<br>Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling<br>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and<br>So leaves me to consider what is breeding<br>That changes thus his manners.
	1	2	499	500	2	6	I dare not know, my<br>lord.
	1	2	501	508	8	63	How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not?<br>Be intelligent to me—’tis thereabouts;<br>For to yourself what you do know, you must,<br>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,<br>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror<br>Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be<br>A party in this alteration, finding<br>Myself thus altered with ’t.
	1	2	509	512	4	27	There is a sickness<br>Which puts some of us in distemper, but<br>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught<br>Of you that yet are well.
	1	2	513	525	13	77	How caught of me?<br>Make me not sighted like the basilisk.<br>I have looked on thousands who have sped the<br>better<br>By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,<br>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto<br>Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns<br>Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,<br>In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,<br>If you know aught which does behoove my<br>knowledge<br>Thereof to be informed, imprison ’t not<br>In ignorant concealment.
	1	2	526	526	1	4	I may not answer.
	1	2	527	535	9	73	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?<br>I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?<br>I conjure thee by all the parts of man<br>Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least<br>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare<br>What incidency thou dost guess of harm<br>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;<br>Which way to be prevented, if to be;<br>If not, how best to bear it.
	1	2	536	541	6	45	Sir, I will tell you,<br>Since I am charged in honor and by him<br>That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,<br>Which must be e’en as swiftly followed as<br>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me<br>Cry lost, and so goodnight.
	1	2	542	542	1	3	On, good Camillo.
	1	2	543	543	1	7	I am appointed him to murder you.
	1	2	544	544	1	3	By whom, Camillo?
	1	2	545	545	1	3	By the King.
	1	2	546	546	1	2	For what?
	1	2	547	550	4	29	He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears,<br>As he had seen ’t or been an instrument<br>To vice you to ’t, that you have touched his queen<br>Forbiddenly.
	1	2	551	558	8	58	O, then my best blood turn<br>To an infected jelly, and my name<br>Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!<br>Turn then my freshest reputation to<br>A savor that may strike the dullest nostril<br>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,<br>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection<br>That e’er was heard or read.
	1	2	559	566	8	55	Swear his thought over<br>By each particular star in heaven and<br>By all their influences, you may as well<br>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon<br>As or by oath remove or counsel shake<br>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation<br>Is piled upon his faith and will continue<br>The standing of his body.
	1	2	567	567	1	4	How should this grow?
	1	2	568	583	16	119	I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to<br>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.<br>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,<br>That lies enclosèd in this trunk which you<br>Shall bear along impawned, away tonight!<br>Your followers I will whisper to the business,<br>And will by twos and threes at several posterns<br>Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put<br>My fortunes to your service, which are here<br>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,<br>For, by the honor of my parents, I<br>Have uttered truth—which if you seek to prove,<br>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer<br>Than one condemned by the King’s own mouth,<br>thereon<br>His execution sworn.
	1	2	58	59	2	10	Stay your thanks awhile,<br>And pay them when you part.
	1	2	584	600	17	132	I do believe thee.<br>I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand.<br>Be pilot to me and thy places shall<br>Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and<br>My people did expect my hence departure<br>Two days ago. This jealousy<br>Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare,<br>Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,<br>Must it be violent; and as he does conceive<br>He is dishonored by a man which ever<br>Professed to him, why, his revenges must<br>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.<br>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort<br>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing<br>Of his ill-ta’en suspicion. Come, Camillo,<br>I will respect thee as a father if<br>Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.
	1	2	60	65	6	44	Sir, that’s tomorrow.<br>I am questioned by my fears of what may chance<br>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow<br>No sneaping winds at home to make us say<br><span class="quote" data-words="6">This is put forth too truly.</span> Besides, I have stayed<br>To tire your Royalty.
	1	2	601	603	3	24	It is in mine authority to command<br>The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness<br>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
	1	2	66	67	2	11	We are tougher, brother,<br>Than you can put us to ’t.
	1	2	68	68	1	3	No longer stay.
	1	2	69	69	1	3	One sev’nnight longer.
	1	2	70	70	1	3	Very sooth, tomorrow.
	1	2	71	72	2	13	We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that<br>I’ll no gainsaying.
	1	2	73	82	10	72	Press me not, beseech you, so.<br>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’<br>world,<br>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,<br>Were there necessity in your request, although<br>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs<br>Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder<br>Were in your love a whip to me, my stay<br>To you a charge and trouble. To save both,<br>Farewell, our brother.
	1	2	83	84	2	5	Tongue-tied, our queen?<br>Speak you.
	1	2	85	90	6	50	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until<br>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,<br>Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure<br>All in Bohemia’s well. This satisfaction<br>The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him,<br>He’s beat from his best ward.
	1	2	91	91	1	3	Well said, Hermione.
	1	2	92	103	12	96	To tell he longs to see his son were strong.<br>But let him say so then, and let him go.<br>But let him swear so and he shall not stay;<br>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.<br>Yet of your royal presence I’ll<br>adventure<br>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia<br>You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission<br>To let him there a month behind the gest<br>Prefixed for ’s parting.—Yet, good deed, Leontes,<br>I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind<br>What lady she her lord.—You’ll stay?
	2	1	604	605	2	12	Take the boy to you. He so troubles me<br>’Tis past enduring.
	2	1	606	607	2	9	Come, my gracious lord,<br>Shall I be your playfellow?
	2	1	608	608	1	5	No, I’ll none of you.
	2	1	609	609	1	4	Why, my sweet lord?
	2	1	610	611	2	19	You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if<br>I were a baby still.—I love you better.
	2	1	612	612	1	5	And why so, my lord?
	2	1	613	617	5	36	Not for because<br>Your brows are blacker—yet black brows, they say,<br>Become some women best, so that there be not<br>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,<br>Or a half-moon made with a pen.
	2	1	618	618	1	3	Who taught this?
	2	1	619	620	2	14	I learned it out of women’s faces.—Pray now,<br>What color are your eyebrows?
	2	1	621	621	1	3	Blue, my lord.
	2	1	622	623	2	18	Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose<br>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
	2	1	624	628	5	33	Hark ye,<br>The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall<br>Present our services to a fine new prince<br>One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us<br>If we would have you.
	2	1	629	630	2	13	She is spread of late<br>Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!
	2	1	631	633	3	23	What wisdom stirs amongst you?—Come, sir, now<br>I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,<br>And tell ’s a tale.
	2	1	634	634	1	6	Merry or sad shall ’t be?
	2	1	635	635	1	5	As merry as you will.
	2	1	636	637	2	13	A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one<br>Of sprites and goblins.
	2	1	638	640	3	25	Let’s have that, good sir.<br>Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best<br>To fright me with your sprites. You’re powerful at it.
	2	1	641	641	1	4	There was a man—
	2	1	642	642	1	6	Nay, come sit down, then on.
	2	1	643	644	2	15	Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,<br>Yond crickets shall not hear it.
	2	1	645	645	1	10	Come on then, and give ’t me in mine ear.
	2	1	646	646	1	9	Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?
	2	1	647	649	3	24	Behind the tuft of pines I met them. Never<br>Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them<br>Even to their ships.
	2	1	650	667	18	139	How blest am I<br>In my just censure, in my true opinion!<br>Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed<br>In being so blest! There may be in the cup<br>A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,<br>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge<br>Is not infected; but if one present<br>Th’ abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known<br>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,<br>With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.<br>Camillo was his help in this, his pander.<br>There is a plot against my life, my crown.<br>All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain<br>Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.<br>He has discovered my design, and I<br>Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick<br>For them to play at will. How came the posterns<br>So easily open?
	2	1	668	670	3	15	By his great authority,<br>Which often hath no less prevailed than so<br>On your command.
	2	1	671	675	5	35	I know ’t too well.<br>Give me the boy. I am glad you did<br>not nurse him.<br>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you<br>Have too much blood in him.
	2	1	676	676	1	4	What is this? Sport?
	2	1	677	681	5	33	Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.<br>Away with him, and let her sport herself<br>With that she’s big with, for ’tis<br>Polixenes<br>Has made thee swell thus.
	2	1	682	684	3	21	But I’d say he had not,<br>And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,<br>Howe’er you lean to th’ nayward.
	2	1	685	700	16	115	You, my lords,<br>Look on her, mark her well. Be but about<br>To say <span class="quote" data-words="5">She is a goodly lady,</span> and<br>The justice of your hearts will thereto add<br><span class="quote" data-words="6">’Tis pity she’s not honest, honorable.</span><br>Praise her but for this her without-door form,<br>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and<br>straight<br>The shrug, the <span class="quote" data-words="1">hum,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="1">ha,</span> these petty brands<br>That calumny doth use—O, I am out,<br>That mercy does, for calumny will sear<br>Virtue itself—these shrugs, these <span class="" data-words="0"><span class="quote" data-words="0">hum</span></span>s and <span class="" data-words="0"><span class="quote" data-words="0">ha</span></span>s,<br>When you have said she’s goodly, come between<br>Ere you can say she’s honest. But be ’t known,<br>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,<br>She’s an adult’ress.
	2	1	701	704	4	24	Should a villain say so,<br>The most replenished villain in the world,<br>He were as much more villain. You, my lord,<br>Do but mistake.
	2	1	705	719	15	105	You have mistook, my lady,<br>Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,<br>Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place<br>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,<br>Should a like language use to all degrees,<br>And mannerly distinguishment leave out<br>Betwixt the prince and beggar.—I have said<br>She’s an adult’ress; I have said with whom.<br>More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is<br>A federary with her, and one that knows<br>What she should shame to know herself<br>But with her most vile principal: that she’s<br>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those<br>That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy<br>To this their late escape.
	2	1	720	725	6	42	No, by my life,<br>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,<br>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<br>You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,<br>You scarce can right me throughly then to say<br>You did mistake.
	2	1	726	731	6	41	No. If I mistake<br>In those foundations which I build upon,<br>The center is not big enough to bear<br>A schoolboy’s top.—Away with her to prison.<br>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty<br>But that he speaks.
	2	1	732	742	11	82	There’s some ill planet reigns.<br>I must be patient till the heavens look<br>With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,<br>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<br>Commonly are, the want of which vain dew<br>Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have<br>That honorable grief lodged here which burns<br>Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,<br>With thoughts so qualified as your charities<br>Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>The King’s will be performed.
	2	1	743	743	1	4	Shall I be heard?
	2	1	744	753	10	81	Who is ’t that goes with me? Beseech your Highness<br>My women may be with me, for you see<br>My plight requires it.—Do not weep, good fools;<br>There is no cause. When you shall know your<br>mistress<br>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<br>As I come out. This action I now go on<br>Is for my better grace.—Adieu, my lord.<br>I never wished to see you sorry; now<br>I trust I shall.—My women, come; you have leave.
	2	1	754	754	1	5	Go, do our bidding. Hence!
	2	1	755	755	1	7	Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.
	2	1	756	758	3	23	Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice<br>Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer:<br>Yourself, your queen, your son.
	2	1	759	763	5	41	For her, my lord,<br>I dare my life lay down—and will do ’t, sir,<br>Please you t’ accept it—that the Queen is spotless<br>I’ th’ eyes of heaven, and to you—I mean<br>In this which you accuse her.
	2	1	764	770	7	50	If it prove<br>She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where<br>I lodge my wife. I’ll go in couples with her;<br>Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her.<br>For every inch of woman in the world,<br>Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false,<br>If she be.
	2	1	771	771	1	3	Hold your peaces.
	2	1	772	772	1	3	Good my lord—
	2	1	773	784	12	91	It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.<br>You are abused, and by some putter-on<br>That will be damned for ’t. Would I knew the<br>villain!<br>I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flawed,<br>I have three daughters—the eldest is eleven;<br>The second and the third, nine and some five;<br>If this prove true, they’ll pay for ’t. By mine honor,<br>I’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see<br>To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,<br>And I had rather glib myself than they<br>Should not produce fair issue.
	2	1	785	789	5	38	Cease. No more.<br>You smell this business with a sense as cold<br>As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see ’t and feel ’t,<br>As you feel doing thus, and see withal<br>The instruments that feel.
	2	1	790	793	4	26	If it be so,<br>We need no grave to bury honesty.<br>There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten<br>Of the whole dungy Earth.
	2	1	794	794	1	4	What? Lack I credit?
	2	1	795	798	4	34	I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,<br>Upon this ground. And more it would content me<br>To have her honor true than your suspicion,<br>Be blamed for ’t how you might.
	2	1	799	808	10	69	Why, what need we<br>Commune with you of this, but rather follow<br>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative<br>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness<br>Imparts this, which if you—or stupefied<br>Or seeming so in skill—cannot or will not<br>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves<br>We need no more of your advice. The matter,<br>The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on ’t is all<br>Properly ours.
	2	1	809	811	3	17	And I wish, my liege,<br>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,<br>Without more overture.
	2	1	812	828	17	113	How could that be?<br>Either thou art most ignorant by age,<br>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,<br>Added to their familiarity—<br>Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,<br>That lacked sight only, naught for approbation<br>But only seeing, all other circumstances<br>Made up to th’ deed—doth push on this<br>proceeding.<br>Yet, for a greater confirmation—<br>For in an act of this importance ’twere<br>Most piteous to be wild—I have dispatched in post<br>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,<br>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know<br>Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle<br>They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had<br>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
	2	1	829	830	2	4	Well done,<br>my lord.
	2	1	831	840	10	80	Though I am satisfied and need no more<br>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle<br>Give rest to th’ minds of others, such as he<br>Whose ignorant credulity will not<br>Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good<br>From our free person she should be confined,<br>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence<br>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.<br>We are to speak in public, for this business<br>Will raise us all.
	2	1	841	842	2	12	To laughter, as I take it,<br>If the good truth were known.
	2	2	843	849	7	48	The keeper of the prison, call to him.<br>Let him have knowledge who I am.<br>Good lady,<br>No court in Europe is too good for thee.<br>What dost thou then in prison?<br>Now, good sir,<br>You know me, do you not?
	2	2	850	851	2	10	For a worthy lady<br>And one who much I honor.
	2	2	852	853	2	8	Pray you then,<br>Conduct me to the Queen.
	2	2	854	855	2	11	I may not, madam.<br>To the contrary I have express commandment.
	2	2	856	858	3	27	Here’s ado, to lock up honesty and honor from<br>Th’ access of gentle visitors. Is ’t lawful, pray you,<br>To see her women? Any of them? Emilia?
	2	2	859	861	3	15	So please you, madam,<br>To put apart these your attendants, I<br>Shall bring Emilia forth.
	2	2	862	863	2	7	I pray now, call her.—<br>Withdraw yourselves.
	2	2	864	864	1	9	And, madam, I must be present at your conference.
	2	2	865	869	5	30	Well, be ’t so, prithee.<br>Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain<br>As passes coloring.<br>Dear gentlewoman,<br>How fares our gracious lady?
	2	2	870	873	4	31	As well as one so great and so forlorn<br>May hold together. On her frights and griefs,<br>Which never tender lady hath borne greater,<br>She is something before her time delivered.
	2	2	874	874	1	2	A boy?
	2	2	875	877	4	27	A daughter, and a goodly babe,<br>Lusty and like to live. The Queen receives<br>Much comfort in ’t, says <span class="quote" data-words="8">My poor prisoner,I am innocent as you.</span>
	2	2	879	893	15	108	I dare be sworn.<br>These dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ King, beshrew<br>them!<br>He must be told on ’t, and he shall. The office<br>Becomes a woman best. I’ll take ’t upon me.<br>If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister<br>And never to my red-looked anger be<br>The trumpet anymore. Pray you, Emilia,<br>Commend my best obedience to the Queen.<br>If she dares trust me with her little babe,<br>I’ll show ’t the King and undertake to be<br>Her advocate to th’ loud’st We do not know<br>How he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child.<br>The silence often of pure innocence<br>Persuades when speaking fails.
	2	2	894	903	10	69	Most worthy madam,<br>Your honor and your goodness is so evident<br>That your free undertaking cannot miss<br>A thriving issue. There is no lady living<br>So meet for this great errand. Please your Ladyship<br>To visit the next room, I’ll presently<br>Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer,<br>Who but today hammered of this design,<br>But durst not tempt a minister of honor<br>Lest she should be denied.
	2	2	904	907	4	28	Tell her, Emilia,<br>I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from ’t<br>As boldness from my bosom, let ’t not be doubted<br>I shall do good.
	2	2	908	910	3	15	Now be you blest for it!<br>I’ll to the Queen. Please you come something<br>nearer.
	2	2	911	913	3	23	Madam, if ’t please the Queen to send the babe,<br>I know not what I shall incur to pass it,<br>Having no warrant.
	2	2	914	919	6	46	You need not fear it, sir.<br>This child was prisoner to the womb, and is<br>By law and process of great nature thence<br>Freed and enfranchised, not a party to<br>The anger of the King, nor guilty of,<br>If any be, the trespass of the Queen.
	2	2	920	920	1	4	I do believe it.
	2	2	921	922	2	14	Do not you fear. Upon mine honor, I<br>Will stand betwixt you and danger.
	2	3	1005	1007	3	14	Out!<br>A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door.<br>A most intelligencing bawd.
	2	3	1008	1012	5	35	Not so.<br>I am as ignorant in that as you<br>In so entitling me, and no less honest<br>Than you are mad—which is enough, I’ll warrant,<br>As this world goes, to pass for honest.
	2	3	1013	1018	6	38	Traitors,<br>Will you not push her out? Give her<br>the bastard,<br>Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted<br>By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,<br>Take ’t up, I say. Give ’t to thy crone.
	2	3	1019	1022	4	21	Forever<br>Unvenerable be thy hands if thou<br>Tak’st up the Princess by that forced baseness<br>Which he has put upon ’t.
	2	3	1023	1023	1	4	He dreads his wife.
	2	3	1024	1025	2	15	So I would you did. Then ’twere past all doubt<br>You’d call your children yours.
	2	3	1026	1026	1	4	A nest of traitors!
	2	3	1027	1027	1	7	I am none, by this good light.
	2	3	1028	1037	10	71	Nor I, nor any<br>But one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he<br>The sacred honor of himself, his queen’s,<br>His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,<br>Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will<br>not—<br>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse<br>He cannot be compelled to ’t—once remove<br>The root of his opinion, which is rotten<br>As ever oak or stone was sound.
	2	3	1038	1044	7	40	A callet<br>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her<br>husband<br>And now baits me! This brat is none of mine.<br>It is the issue of Polixenes.<br>Hence with it, and together with the dam<br>Commit them to the fire.
	2	3	1045	1058	14	110	It is yours,<br>And, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,<br>So like you ’tis the worse.—Behold, my lords,<br>Although the print be little, the whole matter<br>And copy of the father—eye, nose, lip,<br>The trick of ’s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,<br>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his<br>smiles,<br>The very mold and frame of hand, nail, finger.<br>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it<br>So like to him that got it, if thou hast<br>The ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colors<br>No yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does,<br>Her children not her husband’s.
	2	3	1059	1061	3	17	A gross hag!—<br>And, losel, thou art worthy to be hanged<br>That wilt not stay her tongue.
	2	3	1062	1064	3	15	Hang all the husbands<br>That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself<br>Hardly one subject.
	2	3	1065	1065	1	5	Once more, take her hence.
	2	3	1066	1067	2	10	A most unworthy and unnatural lord<br>Can do no more.
	2	3	1068	1068	1	4	I’ll ha’ thee burnt.
	2	3	1069	1077	9	55	I care not.<br>It is an heretic that makes the fire,<br>Not she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;<br>But this most cruel usage of your queen,<br>Not able to produce more accusation<br>Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something<br>savors<br>Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,<br>Yea, scandalous to the world.
	2	3	1078	1081	4	32	On your allegiance,<br>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,<br>Where were her life? She durst not call me so<br>If she did know me one. Away with her!
	2	3	1082	1087	6	53	I pray you do not push me; I’ll be gone.—<br>Look to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours. Jove send her<br>A better guiding spirit.—What needs these hands?<br>You that are thus so tender o’er his follies<br>Will never do him good, not one of you.<br>So, so. Farewell, we are gone.
	2	3	1088	1099	12	102	Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.<br>My child? Away with ’t! Even thou, that hast<br>A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,<br>And see it instantly consumed with fire.<br>Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.<br>Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,<br>And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,<br>With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse<br>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so.<br>The bastard brains with these my proper hands<br>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,<br>For thou sett’st on thy wife.
	2	3	1100	1102	3	17	I did not, sir.<br>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,<br>Can clear me in ’t.
	2	3	1103	1104	2	13	We can, my royal liege.<br>He is not guilty of her coming hither.
	2	3	1105	1105	1	3	You’re liars all.
	2	3	1106	1112	7	58	Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.<br>We have always truly served you, and beseech<br>So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,<br>As recompense of our dear services<br>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,<br>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must<br>Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
	2	3	1113	1124	12	84	I am a feather for each wind that blows.<br>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel<br>And call me father? Better burn it now<br>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.<br>It shall not neither. You, sir, come<br>you hither,<br>You that have been so tenderly officious<br>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,<br>To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,<br>So sure as this beard’s gray. What will you<br>adventure<br>To save this brat’s life?
	2	3	1125	1129	5	30	Anything, my lord,<br>That my ability may undergo<br>And nobleness impose. At least thus much:<br>I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left<br>To save the innocent. Anything possible.
	2	3	1130	1131	2	13	It shall be possible. Swear by this sword<br>Thou wilt perform my bidding.
	2	3	1132	1132	1	4	I will, my lord.
	2	3	1133	1146	14	122	Mark, and perform it, seest thou; for the fail<br>Of any point in ’t shall not only be<br>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,<br>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,<br>As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry<br>This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it<br>To some remote and desert place quite out<br>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,<br>Without more mercy, to it own protection<br>And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune<br>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,<br>On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,<br>That thou commend it strangely to some place<br>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
	2	3	1147	1155	9	75	I swear to do this, though a present death<br>Had been more merciful.—Come on, poor babe.<br>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens<br>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,<br>Casting their savageness aside, have done<br>Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous<br>In more than this deed does require.—And blessing<br>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,<br>Poor thing, condemned to loss.
	2	3	1156	1157	2	6	No, I’ll not rear<br>Another’s issue.
	2	3	1158	1162	5	31	Please your Highness, posts<br>From those you sent to th’ oracle are come<br>An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,<br>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,<br>Hasting to th’ court.
	2	3	1163	1164	2	10	So please you, sir, their speed<br>Hath been beyond account.
	2	3	1165	1174	10	69	Twenty-three days<br>They have been absent. ’Tis good speed, foretells<br>The great Apollo suddenly will have<br>The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.<br>Summon a session, that we may arraign<br>Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath<br>Been publicly accused, so shall she have<br>A just and open trial. While she lives,<br>My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,<br>And think upon my bidding.
	2	3	923	931	9	78	Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness<br>To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If<br>The cause were not in being—part o’ th’ cause,<br>She th’ adult’ress, for the harlot king<br>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank<br>And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she<br>I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,<br>Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest<br>Might come to me again.—Who’s there?
	2	3	932	932	1	2	My lord.
	2	3	933	933	1	4	How does the boy?
	2	3	934	935	2	11	He took good rest tonight. ’Tis hoped<br>His sickness is discharged.
	2	3	936	951	16	116	To see his nobleness,<br>Conceiving the dishonor of his mother.<br>He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,<br>Fastened and fixed the shame on ’t in himself,<br>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,<br>And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,<br>See how he fares.<br>Fie, fie, no thought of him.<br>The very thought of my revenges that way<br>Recoil upon me—in himself too mighty,<br>And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be<br>Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,<br>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes<br>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.<br>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor<br>Shall she within my power.
	2	3	952	952	1	4	You must not enter.
	2	3	953	956	4	30	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.<br>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,<br>Than the Queen’s life? A gracious innocent soul,<br>More free than he is jealous.
	2	3	957	957	1	2	That’s enough.
	2	3	958	959	2	12	Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded<br>None should come at him.
	2	3	960	967	8	61	Not so hot, good sir.<br>I come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you<br>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh<br>At each his needless heavings, such as you<br>Nourish the cause of his awaking. I<br>Do come with words as medicinal as true,<br>Honest as either, to purge him of that humor<br>That presses him from sleep.
	2	3	968	968	1	4	What noise there, ho?
	2	3	969	970	2	13	No noise, my lord, but needful conference<br>About some gossips for your Highness.
	2	3	971	974	4	21	How?—<br>Away with that audacious lady. Antigonus,<br>I charged thee that she should not come about me.<br>I knew she would.
	2	3	975	977	3	18	I told her so, my lord,<br>On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,<br>She should not visit you.
	2	3	978	978	1	5	What, canst not rule her?
	2	3	979	982	4	28	From all dishonesty he can. In this,<br>Unless he take the course that you have done—<br>Commit me for committing honor—trust it,<br>He shall not rule me.
	2	3	983	985	3	19	La you now, you hear.<br>When she will take the rein I let her run,<br>But she’ll not stumble.
	2	3	986	992	7	47	Good my liege, I come—<br>And I beseech you hear me, who professes<br>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,<br>Your most obedient counselor, yet that dares<br>Less appear so in comforting your evils<br>Than such as most seem yours—I say I come<br>From your good queen.
	2	3	993	993	1	2	Good queen?
	2	3	994	996	4	26	Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say <span class="quote" data-words="2">goodqueen,</span><br>And would by combat make her good, so were I<br>A man, the worst about you.
	2	3	998	998	1	3	Force her hence.
	2	3	999	1004	6	44	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes<br>First hand me. On mine own accord I’ll off,<br>But first I’ll do my errand.—The good queen,<br>For she is good, hath brought you forth a<br>daughter—<br>Here ’tis—commends it to your blessing.
	3	1	1175	1177	3	19	The climate’s delicate, the air most sweet,<br>Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing<br>The common praise it bears.
	3	1	1178	1183	6	37	I shall report,<br>For most it caught me, the celestial habits—<br>Methinks I so should term them—and the reverence<br>Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice,<br>How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly<br>It was i’ th’ off’ring!
	3	1	1184	1187	4	24	But of all, the burst<br>And the ear-deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle,<br>Kin to Jove’s thunder, so surprised my sense<br>That I was nothing.
	3	1	1188	1191	4	33	If th’ event o’ th’ journey<br>Prove as successful to the Queen—O, be ’t so!—<br>As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,<br>The tune is worth the use on ’t.
	3	1	1192	1195	4	17	Great Apollo<br>Turn all to th’ best! These proclamations,<br>So forcing faults upon Hermione,<br>I little like.
	3	1	1196	1201	6	41	The violent carriage of it<br>Will clear or end the business when the oracle,<br>Thus by Apollo’s great divine sealed up,<br>Shall the contents discover. Something rare<br>Even then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses;<br>And gracious be the issue.
	3	2	1202	1209	8	59	This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,<br>Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried<br>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one<br>Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared<br>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly<br>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course<br>Even to the guilt or the purgation.<br>Produce the prisoner.
	3	2	1210	1212	3	24	It is his Highness’ pleasure that the Queen<br>Appear in person here in court.<br>Silence!
	3	2	1213	1213	1	3	Read the indictment.
	3	2	1214	1213	10	79	<span class="letter" data-words="79">Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes,<br>King of Sicilia, than art here accused and arraigned<br>of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,<br>King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo<br>to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy<br>royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances<br>partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to<br>the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel<br>and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by<br>night.</span>
	3	2	1224	1256	33	263	Since what I am to say must be but that<br>Which contradicts my accusation, and<br>The testimony on my part no other<br>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me<br>To say <span class="quote" data-words="2">Not guilty.</span> Mine integrity,<br>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<br>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<br>Behold our human actions, as they do,<br>I doubt not then but innocence shall make<br>False accusation blush and tyranny<br>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<br>Whom least will seem to do so, my past life<br>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>As I am now unhappy; which is more<br>Than history can pattern, though devised<br>And played to take spectators. For behold me,<br>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe<br>A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,<br>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<br>To prate and talk for life and honor fore<br>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<br>As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor,<br>’Tis a derivative from me to mine,<br>And only that I stand for. I appeal<br>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<br>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<br>How merited to be so; since he came,<br>With what encounter so uncurrent I<br>Have strained t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond<br>The bound of honor, or in act or will<br>That way inclining, hardened be the hearts<br>Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin<br>Cry fie upon my grave.
	3	2	1257	1260	4	23	I ne’er heard yet<br>That any of these bolder vices wanted<br>Less impudence to gainsay what they did<br>Than to perform it first.
	3	2	1261	1262	2	12	That’s true enough,<br>Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
	3	2	1263	1263	1	5	You will not own it.
	3	2	1264	1282	19	145	More than mistress of<br>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not<br>At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,<br>With whom I am accused, I do confess<br>I loved him as in honor he required,<br>With such a kind of love as might become<br>A lady like me, with a love even such,<br>So and no other, as yourself commanded,<br>Which not to have done, I think, had been in me<br>Both disobedience and ingratitude<br>To you and toward your friend, whose love had<br>spoke,<br>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely<br>That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,<br>I know not how it tastes, though it be dished<br>For me to try how. All I know of it<br>Is that Camillo was an honest man;<br>And why he left your court, the gods themselves,<br>Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
	3	2	1283	1284	2	17	You knew of his departure, as you know<br>What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.
	3	2	1285	1288	4	22	Sir,<br>You speak a language that I understand not.<br>My life stands in the level of your dreams,<br>Which I’ll lay down.
	3	2	1289	1298	10	79	Your actions are my dreams.<br>You had a bastard by Polixenes,<br>And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame—<br>Those of your fact are so—so past all truth,<br>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as<br>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,<br>No father owning it—which is indeed<br>More criminal in thee than it—so thou<br>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage<br>Look for no less than death.
	3	2	1299	1324	26	204	Sir, spare your threats.<br>The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<br>To me can life be no commodity.<br>The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,<br>I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,<br>But know not how it went. My second joy<br>And first fruits of my body, from his presence<br>I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,<br>Starred most unluckily, is from my breast,<br>The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth,<br>Haled out to murder; myself on every post<br>Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred<br>The childbed privilege denied, which longs<br>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<br>Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before<br>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<br>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<br>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<br>But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life,<br>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,<br>Which I would free), if I shall be condemned<br>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else<br>But what your jealousies awake, I tell you<br>’Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all,<br>I do refer me to the oracle.<br>Apollo be my judge.
	3	2	1325	1327	3	15	This your request<br>Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,<br>And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.
	3	2	1328	1332	5	35	The Emperor of Russia was my father.<br>O, that he were alive and here beholding<br>His daughter’s trial, that he did but see<br>The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes<br>Of pity, not revenge.
	3	2	1333	1340	8	54	You here shall swear upon this sword of justice<br>That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have<br>Been both at Delphos, and from thence have<br>brought<br>This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered<br>Of great Apollo’s priest, and that since then<br>You have not dared to break the holy seal<br>Nor read the secrets in ’t.
	3	2	1341	1341	1	4	All this we swear.
	3	2	1342	1342	1	6	Break up the seals and read.
	3	2	1343	1342	5	34	<span class="letter" data-words="34">Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless,<br>Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant,<br>his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall<br>live without an heir if that which is lost be not<br>found.</span>
	3	2	1348	1348	1	6	Now blessèd be the great Apollo!
	3	2	1349	1349	1	1	Praised!
	3	2	1350	1350	1	4	Hast thou read truth?
	3	2	1351	1351	1	11	Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.
	3	2	1352	1353	2	17	There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.<br>The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.
	3	2	1354	1354	1	6	My lord the King, the King!
	3	2	1355	1355	1	4	What is the business?
	3	2	1356	1358	3	24	O sir, I shall be hated to report it.<br>The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear<br>Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.
	3	2	1359	1359	1	2	How? Gone?
	3	2	1360	1360	1	2	Is dead.
	3	2	1361	1363	3	16	Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves<br>Do strike at my injustice.<br>How now there?
	3	2	1364	1365	2	15	This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down<br>And see what death is doing.
	3	2	1366	1390	25	173	Take her hence.<br>Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover.<br>I have too much believed mine own suspicion.<br>Beseech you, tenderly apply to her<br>Some remedies for life.<br>Apollo, pardon<br>My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle.<br>I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,<br>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,<br>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;<br>For, being transported by my jealousies<br>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose<br>Camillo for the minister to poison<br>My friend Polixenes, which had been done<br>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied<br>My swift command, though I with death and with<br>Reward did threaten and encourage him,<br>Not doing it and being done. He, most humane<br>And filled with honor, to my kingly guest<br>Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,<br>Which you knew great, and to the hazard<br>Of all incertainties himself commended,<br>No richer than his honor. How he glisters<br>Through my rust, and how his piety<br>Does my deeds make the blacker!
	3	2	1391	1393	3	14	Woe the while!<br>O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,<br>Break too!
	3	2	1394	1394	1	6	What fit is this, good lady?
	3	2	1395	1423	29	223	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?<br>What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling<br>In leads or oils? What old or newer torture<br>Must I receive, whose every word deserves<br>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,<br>Together working with thy jealousies,<br>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<br>For girls of nine, O, think what they have done,<br>And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all<br>Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.<br>That thou betrayedst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;<br>That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant<br>And damnable ingrateful. Nor was ’t much<br>Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo’s honor,<br>To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,<br>More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon<br>The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter<br>To be or none or little, though a devil<br>Would have shed water out of fire ere done ’t.<br>Nor is ’t directly laid to thee the death<br>Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,<br>Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart<br>That could conceive a gross and foolish sire<br>Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no,<br>Laid to thy answer. But the last—O lords,<br>When I have said, cry woe!—the Queen, the Queen,<br>The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance<br>for ’t<br>Not dropped down yet.
	3	2	1424	1424	1	4	The higher powers forbid!
	3	2	1425	1436	12	98	I say she’s dead. I’ll swear ’t. If word nor oath<br>Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring<br>Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,<br>Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you<br>As I would do the gods.—But, O thou tyrant,<br>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier<br>Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee<br>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees<br>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,<br>Upon a barren mountain, and still winter<br>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods<br>To look that way thou wert.
	3	2	1437	1439	3	19	Go on, go on.<br>Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved<br>All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.
	3	2	1440	1442	3	17	Say no more.<br>Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault<br>I’ th’ boldness of your speech.
	3	2	1443	1458	16	122	I am sorry for ’t.<br>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,<br>I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much<br>The rashness of a woman. He is touched<br>To th’ noble heart.—What’s gone and what’s past<br>help<br>Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction<br>At my petition. I beseech you, rather<br>Let me be punished, that have minded you<br>Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,<br>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.<br>The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!—<br>I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.<br>I’ll not remember you of my own lord,<br>Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,<br>And I’ll say nothing.
	3	2	1459	1470	12	94	Thou didst speak but well<br>When most the truth, which I receive much better<br>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me<br>To the dead bodies of my queen and son.<br>One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall<br>The causes of their death appear, unto<br>Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit<br>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there<br>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature<br>Will bear up with this exercise, so long<br>I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me<br>To these sorrows.
	3	3	1471	1472	2	13	Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon<br>The deserts of Bohemia?
	3	3	1473	1477	5	36	Ay, my lord, and fear<br>We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly<br>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,<br>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry<br>And frown upon ’s.
	3	3	1478	1480	3	21	Their sacred wills be done. Go, get aboard.<br>Look to thy bark. I’ll not be long before<br>I call upon thee.
	3	3	1481	1484	4	32	Make your best haste, and go not<br>Too far i’ th’ land. ’Tis like to be loud weather.<br>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures<br>Of prey that keep upon ’t.
	3	3	1485	1486	2	6	Go thou away.<br>I’ll follow instantly.
	3	3	1487	1488	2	12	I am glad at heart<br>To be so rid o’ th’ business.
	3	3	1489	1525	46	362	Come, poor babe.<br>I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o’ th’ dead<br>May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother<br>Appeared to me last night, for ne’er was dream<br>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,<br>Sometimes her head on one side, some another.<br>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,<br>So filled and so becoming. In pure white robes,<br>Like very sanctity, she did approach<br>My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,<br>And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes<br>Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon<br>Did this break from her: <span class="quote" data-words="66">Good Antigonus,Since fate, against thy better disposition,<br>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<br>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<br>Places remote enough are in Bohemia.<br>There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe<br>Is counted lost forever, Perdita<br>I prithee call ’t. For this ungentle business<br>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see<br>Thy wife Paulina more.</span> And so, with shrieks,<br>She melted into air. Affrighted much,<br>I did in time collect myself and thought<br>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys,<br>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<br>I will be squared by this. I do believe<br>Hermione hath suffered death, and that<br>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue<br>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<br>Either for life or death, upon the earth<br>Of its right father.—Blossom, speed thee well.<br>There lie, and there thy character; there these,<br>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,<br>And still rest thine. The storm begins.<br>Poor wretch,<br>That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed<br>To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,<br>But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I<br>To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.<br>The day frowns more and more. Thou ’rt like to have<br>A lullaby too rough. I never saw<br>The heavens so dim by day.<br>A savage clamor!<br>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase.<br>I am gone forever!
	3	3	1535	1553	19	174	I would there were no age between ten and<br>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the<br>rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting<br>wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,<br>fighting—Hark you now. Would any but these<br>boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt<br>this weather? They have scared away two of my best<br>sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than<br>the master. If anywhere I have them, ’tis by the<br>seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an ’t be thy will,<br>what have we here? Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very<br>pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty<br>one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I<br>am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman<br>in the scape. This has been some stair-work,<br>some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They<br>were warmer that got this than the poor thing is<br>here. I’ll take it up for pity. Yet I’ll tarry till my son<br>come. He halloed but even now.—Whoa-ho-ho!
	3	3	1554	1554	1	2	Hilloa, loa!
	3	3	1555	1557	3	25	What, art so near? If thou ’lt see a thing to<br>talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.<br>What ail’st thou, man?
	3	3	1558	1561	4	38	I have seen two such sights, by sea<br>and by land—but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is<br>now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it, you<br>cannot thrust a bodkin’s point.
	3	3	1562	1562	1	5	Why, boy, how is it?
	3	3	1563	1577	15	142	I would you did but see how it chafes,<br>how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that’s<br>not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor<br>souls! Sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em.<br>Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast,<br>and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you’d<br>thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land<br>service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone,<br>how he cried to me for help, and said his<br>name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an<br>end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it.<br>But, first, how the poor souls roared and the sea<br>mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared<br>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than<br>the sea or weather.
	3	3	1578	1578	1	7	Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
	3	3	1579	1582	4	31	Now, now. I have not winked since I<br>saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under<br>water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman.<br>He’s at it now.
	3	3	1583	1584	2	11	Would I had been by to have helped the old<br>man.
	3	3	1585	1587	3	20	I would you had been by the ship side,<br>to have helped her. There your charity would have<br>lacked footing.
	3	3	1588	1595	8	68	Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look<br>thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met’st with<br>things dying, I with things newborn. Here’s a sight<br>for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire’s<br>child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open<br>’t. So, let’s see. It was told me I should be rich by<br>the fairies. This is some changeling. Open ’t. What’s<br>within, boy?
	3	3	1596	1598	3	21	You’re a made old<br>man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,<br>you’re well to live. Gold, all gold.
	3	3	1599	1603	5	44	This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so.<br>Up with ’t, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.<br>We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires<br>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good<br>boy, the next way home.
	3	3	1604	1608	5	44	Go you the next way with your<br>findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone from the<br>gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are<br>never curst but when they are hungry. If there be<br>any of him left, I’ll bury it.
	3	3	1609	1611	3	25	That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern<br>by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to<br>th’ sight of him.
	3	3	1612	1613	2	13	Marry, will I, and you shall help to<br>put him i’ th’ ground.
	3	3	1614	1615	2	12	’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good<br>deeds on ’t.
	4	1	1616	1648	33	266	I, that please some, try all—both joy and terror<br>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error—<br>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,<br>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime<br>To me or my swift passage that I slide<br>O’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried<br>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power<br>To o’erthrow law and in one self-born hour<br>To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass<br>The same I am ere ancient’st order was<br>Or what is now received. I witness to<br>The times that brought them in. So shall I do<br>To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale<br>The glistering of this present, as my tale<br>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,<br>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing<br>As you had slept between. Leontes leaving,<br>Th’ effects of his fond jealousies so grieving<br>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,<br>Gentle spectators, that I now may be<br>In fair Bohemia. And remember well<br>I mentioned a son o’ th’ King’s, which Florizell<br>I now name to you, and with speed so pace<br>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace<br>Equal with wond’ring. What of her ensues<br>I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news<br>Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s<br>daughter<br>And what to her adheres, which follows after,<br>Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,<br>If ever you have spent time worse ere now.<br>If never, yet that Time himself doth say<br>He wishes earnestly you never may.
	4	2	1649	1651	3	20	I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more<br>importunate. ’Tis a sickness denying thee anything,<br>a death to grant this.
	4	2	1652	1657	6	58	It is fifteen years since I saw my country.<br>Though I have for the most part been aired abroad,<br>I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent<br>king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling<br>sorrows I might be some allay—or I o’erween to<br>think so—which is another spur to my departure.
	4	2	1658	1677	20	176	As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the<br>rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I<br>have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better<br>not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou,<br>having made me businesses which none without<br>thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to<br>execute them thyself or take away with thee the very<br>services thou hast done, which if I have not enough<br>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more<br>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit<br>therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country<br>Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very<br>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that<br>penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king<br>my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen<br>and children are even now to be afresh lamented.<br>Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my<br>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not<br>being gracious, than they are in losing them when<br>they have approved their virtues.
	4	2	1678	1682	5	46	Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.<br>What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown,<br>but I have missingly noted he is of late<br>much retired from court and is less frequent to his<br>princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
	4	2	1683	1690	8	63	I have considered so much, Camillo, and<br>with some care, so far that I have eyes under my<br>service which look upon his removedness, from<br>whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom<br>from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man,<br>they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the<br>imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an<br>unspeakable estate.
	4	2	1691	1694	4	33	I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a<br>daughter of most rare note. The report of her is<br>extended more than can be thought to begin from<br>such a cottage.
	4	2	1695	1702	8	69	That’s likewise part of my intelligence, but,<br>I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou<br>shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not<br>appearing what we are, have some question with<br>the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not<br>uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither.<br>Prithee be my present partner in this business, and<br>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
	4	2	1703	1703	1	5	I willingly obey your command.
	4	2	1704	1705	2	7	My best Camillo. We must disguise<br>ourselves.
	4	3	1737	1739	3	22	Let me see, every ’leven wether tods,<br>every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen<br>hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?
	4	3	1742	1756	15	134	I cannot do ’t without counters. Let<br>me see, what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing<br>feast? Three pound of sugar,<br>five pound of currants, rice—what will this sister of<br>mine do with rice? But my father hath made her<br>mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath<br>made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers,<br>three-man song men all, and very good ones;<br>but they are most of them means and basses, but<br>one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to<br>hornpipes. I must have saffron to color the warden<br>pies; mace; dates, none, that’s out of my note;<br>nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I<br>may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of<br>raisins o’ th’ sun.
	4	3	1759	1759	1	5	I’ th’ name of me!
	4	3	1762	1763	2	18	Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of<br>more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off.
	4	3	1767	1768	2	13	Alas, poor man, a million of beating<br>may come to a great matter.
	4	3	1772	1772	1	7	What, by a horseman, or a footman?
	4	3	1774	1778	5	38	Indeed, he should be a footman by<br>the garments he has left with thee. If this be a<br>horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend<br>me thy hand; I’ll help thee. Come, lend me thy<br>hand.
	4	3	1780	1780	1	3	Alas, poor soul.
	4	3	1783	1783	1	4	How now? Canst stand?
	4	3	1787	1788	2	11	Dost lack any money? I have a little<br>money for thee.
	4	3	1794	1795	2	9	What manner of fellow was he that<br>robbed you?
	4	3	1801	1803	3	29	His vices, you would say. There’s no<br>virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to<br>make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide.
	4	3	1811	1812	2	14	Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig!<br>He haunts wakes, fairs, and bearbaitings.
	4	3	1815	1817	3	21	Not a more cowardly rogue in all<br>Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him,<br>he’d have run.
	4	3	1821	1821	1	4	How do you now?
	4	3	1825	1825	1	7	Shall I bring thee on the way?
	4	3	1827	1828	2	12	Then fare thee well. I must go buy<br>spices for our sheep-shearing.
	4	4	1839	1843	5	38	These your unusual weeds to each part of you<br>Does give a life—no shepherdess, but Flora<br>Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing<br>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,<br>And you the queen on ’t.
	4	4	1844	1853	10	77	Sir, my gracious lord,<br>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me;<br>O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,<br>The gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscured<br>With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,<br>Most goddesslike pranked up. But that our feasts<br>In every mess have folly, and the feeders<br>Digest it with a custom, I should blush<br>To see you so attired, swoon, I think,<br>To show myself a glass.
	4	4	1854	1856	3	15	I bless the time<br>When my good falcon made her flight across<br>Thy father’s ground.
	4	4	1857	1865	9	72	Now Jove afford you cause.<br>To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness<br>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble<br>To think your father by some accident<br>Should pass this way as you did. O the Fates,<br>How would he look to see his work, so noble,<br>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how<br>Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts, behold<br>The sternness of his presence?
	4	4	1866	1877	12	79	Apprehend<br>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,<br>Humbling their deities to love, have taken<br>The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter<br>Became a bull, and bellowed; the green Neptune<br>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,<br>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,<br>As I seem now. Their transformations<br>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,<br>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires<br>Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts<br>Burn hotter than my faith.
	4	4	1878	1884	7	41	O, but sir,<br>Your resolution cannot hold when ’tis<br>Opposed, as it must be, by th’ power of the King.<br>One of these two must be necessities,<br>Which then will speak: that you must change this<br>purpose<br>Or I my life.
	4	4	1885	1896	12	91	Thou dear’st Perdita,<br>With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not<br>The mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,<br>Or not my father’s. For I cannot be<br>Mine own, nor anything to any, if<br>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,<br>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.<br>Strangle such thoughts as these with anything<br>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming.<br>Lift up your countenance as it were the day<br>Of celebration of that nuptial which<br>We two have sworn shall come.
	4	4	1897	1898	2	6	O Lady Fortune,<br>Stand you auspicious!
	4	4	1899	1901	3	16	See, your guests approach.<br>Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,<br>And let’s be red with mirth.
	4	4	1902	1917	16	136	Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon<br>This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,<br>Both dame and servant; welcomed all; served all;<br>Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here<br>At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;<br>On his shoulder, and his; her face afire<br>With labor, and the thing she took to quench it<br>She would to each one sip. You are retired<br>As if you were a feasted one and not<br>The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid<br>These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is<br>A way to make us better friends, more known.<br>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself<br>That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,<br>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,<br>As your good flock shall prosper.
	4	4	1918	1927	10	57	Sir, welcome.<br>It is my father’s will I should take on me<br>The hostess-ship o’ th’ day. You’re<br>welcome, sir.—<br>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.—Reverend<br>sirs,<br>For you there’s rosemary and rue. These keep<br>Seeming and savor all the winter long.<br>Grace and remembrance be to you both,<br>And welcome to our shearing.
	4	4	1928	1930	3	15	Shepherdess—<br>A fair one are you—well you fit our ages<br>With flowers of winter.
	4	4	1931	1937	7	50	Sir, the year growing ancient,<br>Not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth<br>Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season<br>Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors,<br>Which some call nature’s bastards. Of that kind<br>Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not<br>To get slips of them.
	4	4	1938	1939	2	7	Wherefore, gentle maiden,<br>Do you neglect them?
	4	4	1940	1942	3	19	For I have heard it said<br>There is an art which in their piedness shares<br>With great creating nature.
	4	4	1943	1952	10	75	Say there be;<br>Yet nature is made better by no mean<br>But nature makes that mean. So, over that art<br>Which you say adds to nature is an art<br>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry<br>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,<br>And make conceive a bark of baser kind<br>By bud of nobler race. This is an art<br>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but<br>The art itself is nature.
	4	4	1953	1953	1	3	So it is.
	4	4	1954	1955	2	13	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,<br>And do not call them bastards.
	4	4	1956	1966	11	79	I’ll not put<br>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,<br>No more than, were I painted, I would wish<br>This youth should say ’twere well, and only<br>therefore<br>Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:<br>Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,<br>The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ th’ sun<br>And with him rises weeping. These are flowers<br>Of middle summer, and I think they are given<br>To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
	4	4	1967	1968	2	14	I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,<br>And only live by gazing.
	4	4	1969	1990	22	150	Out, alas!<br>You’d be so lean that blasts of January<br>Would blow you through and through.<br>Now, my fair’st friend,<br>I would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might<br>Become your time of day<br>and yours, and yours,<br>That wear upon your virgin branches yet<br>Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,<br>For the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall<br>From Dis’s wagon! Daffodils,<br>That come before the swallow dares, and take<br>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,<br>But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes<br>Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,<br>That die unmarried ere they can behold<br>Bright Phoebus in his strength—a malady<br>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and<br>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,<br>The flower-de-luce being one—O, these I lack<br>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,<br>To strew him o’er and o’er.
	4	4	1991	1991	1	4	What, like a corse?
	4	4	1992	1998	7	52	No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,<br>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,<br>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your<br>flowers.<br>Methinks I play as I have seen them do<br>In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine<br>Does change my disposition.
	4	4	1999	2010	12	95	What you do<br>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,<br>I’d have you do it ever. When you sing,<br>I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,<br>Pray so; and for the ord’ring your affairs,<br>To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you<br>A wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do<br>Nothing but that, move still, still so,<br>And own no other function. Each your doing,<br>So singular in each particular,<br>Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,<br>That all your acts are queens.
	4	4	2011	2016	6	41	O Doricles,<br>Your praises are too large. But that your youth<br>And the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t<br>Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,<br>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,<br>You wooed me the false way.
	4	4	2017	2021	5	36	I think you have<br>As little skill to fear as I have purpose<br>To put you to ’t. But come, our dance, I pray.<br>Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair<br>That never mean to part.
	4	4	2022	2022	1	4	I’ll swear for ’em.
	4	4	2023	2026	4	29	This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever<br>Ran on the greensward. Nothing she does or seems<br>But smacks of something greater than herself,<br>Too noble for this place.
	4	4	2027	2029	3	20	He tells her something<br>That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is<br>The queen of curds and cream.
	4	4	2030	2030	1	4	Come on, strike up.
	4	4	2031	2032	2	12	Mopsa must be your mistress? Marry, garlic<br>To mend her kissing with.
	4	4	2033	2033	1	4	Now, in good time!
	4	4	2034	2035	2	13	Not a word, a word. We stand upon our manners.—<br>Come, strike up.
	4	4	2036	2037	2	13	Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this<br>Which dances with your daughter?
	4	4	2038	2046	9	74	They call him Doricles, and boasts himself<br>To have a worthy feeding. But I have it<br>Upon his own report, and I believe it.<br>He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.<br>I think so too, for never gazed the moon<br>Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,<br>As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,<br>I think there is not half a kiss to choose<br>Who loves another best.
	4	4	2047	2047	1	3	She dances featly.
	4	4	2048	2051	4	29	So she does anything, though I report it<br>That should be silent. If young Doricles<br>Do light upon her, she shall bring him that<br>Which he not dreams of.
	4	4	2052	2057	6	54	O, master, if you did but hear the peddler at<br>the door, you would never dance again after a tabor<br>and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He<br>sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He<br>utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s<br>ears grew to his tunes.
	4	4	2058	2061	4	34	He could never come better. He shall<br>come in. I love a ballad but even too well if it be<br>doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant<br>thing indeed and sung lamentably.
	4	4	2062	2070	11	91	He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes.<br>No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He<br>has the prettiest love songs for maids, so without<br>bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate burdens<br>of dildos and fadings, <span class="quote" data-words="5">Jump her and thumpher.</span> And where some stretch-mouthed rascal<br>would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul<br>gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer<br><span class="quote" data-words="7">Whoop, do me no harm, good man</span>; puts him off,<br>slights him, with <span class="quote" data-words="7">Whoop, do me no harm, goodman.</span>
	4	4	2073	2073	1	5	This is a brave fellow.
	4	4	2074	2076	3	14	Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable<br>conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided<br>wares?
	4	4	2077	2084	8	66	He hath ribbons of all the colors i’ th’ rainbow;<br>points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia<br>can learnedly handle, though they come to him by<br>th’ gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns—why,<br>he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses.<br>You would think a smock were a she-angel, he so<br>chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the<br>square on ’t.
	4	4	2085	2086	2	9	Prithee bring him in, and let him<br>approach singing.
	4	4	2087	2088	2	11	Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words<br>in ’s tunes.
	4	4	2089	2090	2	14	You have of these peddlers that have<br>more in them than you’d think, sister.
	4	4	2091	2091	1	8	Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
	4	4	2105	2108	4	32	If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou<br>shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled<br>as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain<br>ribbons and gloves.
	4	4	2109	2110	2	14	I was promised them against the feast, but they<br>come not too late now.
	4	4	2111	2112	2	11	He hath promised you more than that, or there<br>be liars.
	4	4	2113	2115	3	22	He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe<br>he has paid you more, which will shame you to give<br>him again.
	4	4	2116	2122	7	58	Is there no manners left among<br>maids? Will they wear their plackets where they<br>should bear their faces? Is there not milking time,<br>when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle<br>of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling<br>before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whisp’ring.<br>Clamor your tongues, and not a word more.
	4	4	2123	2124	2	16	I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry<br>lace and a pair of sweet gloves.
	4	4	2125	2126	2	17	Have I not told thee how I was cozened<br>by the way and lost all my money?
	4	4	2129	2130	2	9	Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose<br>nothing here.
	4	4	2133	2133	1	4	What hast here? Ballads?
	4	4	2134	2135	2	19	Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print<br>alife, for then we are sure they are true.
	4	4	2140	2140	1	5	Is it true, think you?
	4	4	2142	2142	1	6	Bless me from marrying a usurer!
	4	4	2146	2146	1	5	Pray you now, buy it.
	4	4	2147	2149	3	17	Come on, lay it by, and<br>let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the other<br>things anon.
	4	4	2158	2158	1	6	Is it true too, think you?
	4	4	2161	2161	1	5	Lay it by too. Another.
	4	4	2164	2164	1	5	Let’s have some merry ones.
	4	4	2169	2170	2	18	We can both sing it. If thou ’lt bear a part, thou<br>shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.
	4	4	2171	2171	1	9	We had the tune on ’t a month ago.
	4	4	2190	2195	6	44	We’ll have this song out anon by<br>ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad<br>talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away<br>thy pack after me.—Wenches, I’ll buy for you<br>both.—Peddler, let’s have the first choice.—Follow<br>me, girls.
	4	4	2206	2214	9	67	Master, there is three carters,<br>three shepherds, three neatherds, three swineherds,<br>that have made themselves all men of hair.<br>They call themselves saultiers, and they have a<br>dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of<br>gambols, because they are not in ’t, but they themselves<br>are o’ th’ mind, if it be not too rough for<br>some that know little but bowling, it will please<br>plentifully.
	4	4	2215	2217	3	19	Away! We’ll none on ’t. Here has been too<br>much homely foolery already.—I know, sir, we<br>weary you.
	4	4	2218	2219	2	14	You weary those that refresh us. Pray, let’s<br>see these four threes of herdsmen.
	4	4	2220	2223	4	31	One three of them, by their own report, sir,<br>hath danced before the King, and not the worst of<br>the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’<br>square.
	4	4	2224	2225	2	16	Leave your prating. Since these good men<br>are pleased, let them come in—but quickly now.
	4	4	2226	2226	1	6	Why, they stay at door, sir.
	4	4	2227	2242	16	123	O father, you’ll know more of that hereafter.<br>Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to<br>part them.<br>He’s simple, and tells much. How now,<br>fair shepherd?<br>Your heart is full of something that does take<br>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young<br>And handed love, as you do, I was wont<br>To load my she with knacks. I would have ransacked<br>The peddler’s silken treasury and have poured it<br>To her acceptance. You have let him go<br>And nothing marted with him. If your lass<br>Interpretation should abuse and call this<br>Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited<br>For a reply, at least if you make a care<br>Of happy holding her.
	4	4	2243	2254	12	84	Old sir, I know<br>She prizes not such trifles as these are.<br>The gifts she looks from me are packed and locked<br>Up in my heart, which I have given already,<br>But not delivered. O, hear me breathe<br>my life<br>Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,<br>Hath sometime loved. I take thy hand, this hand<br>As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,<br>Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fanned snow that’s<br>bolted<br>By th’ northern blasts twice o’er.
	4	4	2255	2259	5	31	What follows this?—<br>How prettily th’ young swain seems to wash<br>The hand was fair before.—I have put you out.<br>But to your protestation. Let me hear<br>What you profess.
	4	4	2260	2260	1	6	Do, and be witness to ’t.
	4	4	2261	2261	1	5	And this my neighbor too?
	4	4	2262	2271	10	70	And he, and more<br>Than he, and men—the Earth, the heavens, and<br>all—<br>That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,<br>Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth<br>That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge<br>More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them<br>Without her love; for her employ them all,<br>Commend them and condemn them to her service<br>Or to their own perdition.
	4	4	2272	2272	1	2	Fairly offered.
	4	4	2273	2273	1	5	This shows a sound affection.
	4	4	2274	2275	2	9	But my daughter,<br>Say you the like to him?
	4	4	2276	2279	4	26	I cannot speak<br>So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better.<br>By th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out<br>The purity of his.
	4	4	2280	2283	4	26	Take hands, a bargain.—<br>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t:<br>I give my daughter to him and will make<br>Her portion equal his.
	4	4	2284	2288	5	36	O, that must be<br>I’ th’ virtue of your daughter. One being dead,<br>I shall have more than you can dream of yet,<br>Enough then for your wonder. But come on,<br>Contract us fore these witnesses.
	4	4	2289	2290	2	6	Come, your hand—<br>And daughter, yours.
	4	4	2291	2293	3	9	Soft, swain, awhile, beseech<br>you.<br>Have you a father?
	4	4	2294	2294	1	6	I have, but what of him?
	4	4	2295	2295	1	4	Knows he of this?
	4	4	2296	2296	1	5	He neither does nor shall.
	4	4	2297	2305	9	65	Methinks a father<br>Is at the nuptial of his son a guest<br>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,<br>Is not your father grown incapable<br>Of reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid<br>With age and alt’ring rheums? Can he speak? Hear?<br>Know man from man? Dispute his own estate?<br>Lies he not bedrid, and again does nothing<br>But what he did being childish?
	4	4	2306	2308	3	17	No, good sir.<br>He has his health and ampler strength indeed<br>Than most have of his age.
	4	4	2309	2315	7	46	By my white beard,<br>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong<br>Something unfilial. Reason my son<br>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason<br>The father, all whose joy is nothing else<br>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel<br>In such a business.
	4	4	2316	2319	4	26	I yield all this;<br>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,<br>Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint<br>My father of this business.
	4	4	2320	2320	1	4	Let him know ’t.
	4	4	2321	2321	1	3	He shall not.
	4	4	2322	2322	1	3	Prithee let him.
	4	4	2323	2323	1	4	No, he must not.
	4	4	2324	2325	2	15	Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve<br>At knowing of thy choice.
	4	4	2326	2327	2	8	Come, come, he must not.<br>Mark our contract.
	4	4	2328	2337	10	63	Mark your divorce,<br>young sir,<br>Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base<br>To be acknowledged. Thou a scepter’s heir<br>That thus affects a sheep-hook!—Thou, old traitor,<br>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can<br>But shorten thy life one week.—And thou, fresh<br>piece<br>Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know<br>The royal fool thou cop’st with—
	4	4	2338	2338	1	3	O, my heart!
	4	4	2339	2356	18	145	I’ll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made<br>More homely than thy state.—For thee, fond boy,<br>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh<br>That thou no more shalt see this knack—as never<br>I mean thou shalt—we’ll bar thee from succession,<br>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,<br>Far’r than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.<br>Follow us to the court. Thou, churl,<br>for this time,<br>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee<br>From the dead blow of it.—And you, enchantment,<br>Worthy enough a herdsman—yea, him too,<br>That makes himself, but for our honor therein,<br>Unworthy thee—if ever henceforth thou<br>These rural latches to his entrance open,<br>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,<br>I will devise a death as cruel for thee<br>As thou art tender to ’t.
	4	4	2357	2367	11	84	Even here undone.<br>I was not much afeard, for once or twice<br>I was about to speak and tell him plainly<br>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court<br>Hides not his visage from our cottage but<br>Looks on alike. Will ’t please you, sir,<br>be gone?<br>I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,<br>Of your own state take care. This dream of mine—<br>Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,<br>But milk my ewes and weep.
	4	4	2368	2369	2	8	Why, how now, father?<br>Speak ere thou diest.
	4	4	2370	2384	15	103	I cannot speak, nor think,<br>Nor dare to know that which I know.<br>O sir,<br>You have undone a man of fourscore three,<br>That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,<br>To die upon the bed my father died,<br>To lie close by his honest bones; but now<br>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me<br>Where no priest shovels in dust. O<br>cursèd wretch,<br>That knew’st this was the Prince, and wouldst<br>adventure<br>To mingle faith with him!—Undone, undone!<br>If I might die within this hour, I have lived<br>To die when I desire.
	4	4	2385	2389	5	32	Why look you so upon me?<br>I am but sorry, not afeard; delayed,<br>But nothing altered. What I was, I am,<br>More straining on for plucking back, not following<br>My leash unwillingly.
	4	4	2390	2396	7	50	Gracious my lord,<br>You know your father’s temper. At this time<br>He will allow no speech, which I do guess<br>You do not purpose to him; and as hardly<br>Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.<br>Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,<br>Come not before him.
	4	4	2397	2398	2	7	I not purpose it.<br>I think Camillo?
	4	4	2399	2399	1	4	Even he, my lord.
	4	4	2400	2402	3	20	How often have I told you ’twould be thus?<br>How often said my dignity would last<br>But till ’twere known?
	4	4	2403	2408	6	42	It cannot fail but by<br>The violation of my faith; and then<br>Let nature crush the sides o’ th’ Earth together<br>And mar the seeds within. Lift up thy looks.<br>From my succession wipe me, father. I<br>Am heir to my affection.
	4	4	2409	2409	1	2	Be advised.
	4	4	2410	2413	4	28	I am, and by my fancy. If my reason<br>Will thereto be obedient, I have reason.<br>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,<br>Do bid it welcome.
	4	4	2414	2414	1	4	This is desperate, sir.
	4	4	2415	2433	19	156	So call it; but it does fulfill my vow.<br>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,<br>Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may<br>Be thereat gleaned, for all the sun sees or<br>The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides<br>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath<br>To this my fair beloved. Therefore, I pray you,<br>As you have ever been my father’s honored friend,<br>When he shall miss me, as in faith I mean not<br>To see him anymore, cast your good counsels<br>Upon his passion. Let myself and fortune<br>Tug for the time to come. This you may know<br>And so deliver: I am put to sea<br>With her who here I cannot hold on shore.<br>And most opportune to our need I have<br>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared<br>For this design. What course I mean to hold<br>Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor<br>Concern me the reporting.
	4	4	2434	2436	3	16	O my lord,<br>I would your spirit were easier for advice<br>Or stronger for your need.
	4	4	2437	2438	2	8	Hark, Perdita.—<br>I’ll hear you by and by.
	4	4	2439	2445	7	48	He’s irremovable,<br>Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if<br>His going I could frame to serve my turn,<br>Save him from danger, do him love and honor,<br>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia<br>And that unhappy king, my master, whom<br>I so much thirst to see.
	4	4	2446	2448	3	15	Now, good Camillo,<br>I am so fraught with curious business that<br>I leave out ceremony.
	4	4	2449	2451	3	19	Sir, I think<br>You have heard of my poor services i’ th’ love<br>That I have borne your father?
	4	4	2452	2455	4	26	Very nobly<br>Have you deserved. It is my father’s music<br>To speak your deeds, not little of his care<br>To have them recompensed as thought on.
	4	4	2456	2470	15	102	Well, my<br>lord,<br>If you may please to think I love the King<br>And, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is<br>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,<br>If your more ponderous and settled project<br>May suffer alteration. On mine honor,<br>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving<br>As shall become your Highness, where you may<br>Enjoy your mistress—from the whom I see<br>There’s no disjunction to be made but by,<br>As heavens forfend, your ruin—marry her,<br>And with my best endeavors in your absence,<br>Your discontenting father strive to qualify<br>And bring him up to liking.
	4	4	2471	2474	4	24	How, Camillo,<br>May this, almost a miracle, be done,<br>That I may call thee something more than man,<br>And after that trust to thee?
	4	4	2475	2476	2	9	Have you thought on<br>A place whereto you’ll go?
	4	4	2477	2481	5	32	Not any yet.<br>But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty<br>To what we wildly do, so we profess<br>Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies<br>Of every wind that blows.
	4	4	2482	2495	14	107	Then list to me.<br>This follows: if you will not change your purpose<br>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,<br>And there present yourself and your fair princess,<br>For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes.<br>She shall be habited as it becomes<br>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see<br>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping<br>His welcomes forth, asks thee, the son, forgiveness,<br>As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands<br>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him<br>’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one<br>He chides to hell and bids the other grow<br>Faster than thought or time.
	4	4	2496	2498	3	13	Worthy Camillo,<br>What color for my visitation shall I<br>Hold up before him?
	4	4	2499	2507	9	71	Sent by the King your father<br>To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,<br>The manner of your bearing towards him, with<br>What you, as from your father, shall deliver,<br>Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,<br>The which shall point you forth at every sitting<br>What you must say, that he shall not perceive<br>But that you have your father’s bosom there<br>And speak his very heart.
	4	4	2508	2509	2	11	I am bound to you.<br>There is some sap in this.
	4	4	2510	2521	12	75	A course more promising<br>Than a wild dedication of yourselves<br>To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most<br>certain<br>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,<br>But as you shake off one to take another;<br>Nothing so certain as your anchors, who<br>Do their best office if they can but stay you<br>Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know<br>Prosperity’s the very bond of love,<br>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together<br>Affliction alters.
	4	4	2522	2524	3	18	One of these is true.<br>I think affliction may subdue the cheek<br>But not take in the mind.
	4	4	2525	2528	4	18	Yea, say you so?<br>There shall not at your father’s house these seven<br>years<br>Be born another such.
	4	4	2529	2531	3	17	My good Camillo,<br>She’s as forward of her breeding as she is<br>I’ th’ rear our birth.
	4	4	2532	2534	3	17	I cannot say ’tis pity<br>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress<br>To most that teach.
	4	4	2535	2536	2	9	Your pardon, sir. For this<br>I’ll blush you thanks.
	4	4	2537	2542	6	39	My prettiest Perdita.<br>But O, the thorns we stand upon!—Camillo,<br>Preserver of my father, now of me,<br>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?<br>We are not furnished like Bohemia’s son,<br>Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
	4	4	2543	2548	6	48	My lord,<br>Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes<br>Do all lie there. It shall be so my care<br>To have you royally appointed as if<br>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,<br>That you may know you shall not want, one word.
	4	4	2573	2574	2	18	Nay, but my letters, by this means being there<br>So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
	4	4	2575	2575	1	8	And those that you’ll procure from King Leontes—
	4	4	2576	2576	1	4	Shall satisfy your father.
	4	4	2577	2578	2	9	Happy be you!<br>All that you speak shows fair.
	4	4	2579	2581	3	16	Who have we here?<br>We’ll make an instrument of this, omit<br>Nothing may give us aid.
	4	4	2583	2584	2	17	How now, good fellow? Why shak’st thou so?<br>Fear not, man. Here’s no harm intended to thee.
	4	4	2586	2592	7	56	Why, be so still. Here’s nobody will steal that<br>from thee. Yet for the outside of thy poverty we<br>must make an exchange. Therefore discase thee<br>instantly—thou must think there’s a necessity in<br>’t—and change garments with this gentleman.<br>Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,<br>yet hold thee, there’s some boot.
	4	4	2595	2596	2	9	Nay, prithee, dispatch. The gentleman is half<br>flayed already.
	4	4	2599	2599	1	3	Dispatch, I prithee.
	4	4	2602	2610	9	62	Unbuckle, unbuckle.<br>Fortunate mistress—let my prophecy<br>Come home to you!—you must retire yourself<br>Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat<br>And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,<br>Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken<br>The truth of your own seeming, that you may—<br>For I do fear eyes over—to shipboard<br>Get undescried.
	4	4	2611	2612	2	12	I see the play so lies<br>That I must bear a part.
	4	4	2613	2614	2	6	No remedy.—<br>Have you done there?
	4	4	2615	2616	2	12	Should I now meet my father,<br>He would not call me son.
	4	4	2617	2618	2	18	Nay, you shall have no hat.<br>Come, lady, come.—Farewell, my friend.
	4	4	2620	2621	2	11	O Perdita, what have we twain forgot?<br>Pray you, a word.
	4	4	2622	2627	6	45	What I do next shall be to tell the King<br>Of this escape, and whither they are bound;<br>Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail<br>To force him after, in whose company<br>I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight<br>I have a woman’s longing.
	4	4	2628	2629	2	11	Fortune speed us!—<br>Thus we set on, Camillo, to th’ seaside.
	4	4	2630	2630	1	5	The swifter speed the better.
	4	4	2648	2651	4	28	See, see, what a man<br>you are now! There is no other way but to tell the<br>King she’s a changeling and none of your flesh and<br>blood.
	4	4	2652	2652	1	4	Nay, but hear me.
	4	4	2653	2653	1	4	Nay, but hear me!
	4	4	2654	2654	1	3	Go to, then.
	4	4	2655	2661	7	58	She being none of your flesh and<br>blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the<br>King, and so your flesh and blood is not to be<br>punished by him. Show those things you found<br>about her, those secret things, all but what she has<br>with her. This being done, let the law go whistle, I<br>warrant you.
	4	4	2662	2665	4	38	I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and<br>his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest<br>man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to<br>make me the King’s brother-in-law.
	4	4	2666	2669	4	27	Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest<br>off you could have been to him, and then your<br>blood had been the dearer by I know how much an<br>ounce.
	4	4	2671	2672	2	18	Well, let us to the King. There is that in this<br>fardel will make him scratch his beard.
	4	4	2675	2675	1	6	Pray heartily he be at’ palace.
	4	4	2680	2680	1	8	To th’ palace, an it like your Worship.
	4	4	2685	2685	1	6	We are but plain fellows, sir.
	4	4	2691	2693	3	18	Your Worship had like to have given<br>us one, if you had not taken yourself with the<br>manner.
	4	4	2694	2694	1	9	Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?
	4	4	2705	2705	1	7	My business, sir, is to the King.
	4	4	2707	2707	1	7	I know not, an ’t like you.
	4	4	2708	2709	2	11	<span class="" data-words="0"><span class="foreign" data-words="0" data-lang="">Advocate</span></span>’s the<br>court word for a pheasant. Say you have none.
	4	4	2710	2711	2	9	None, sir. I have no pheasant,<br>cock nor hen.
	4	4	2715	2716	2	7	This cannot be but a<br>great courtier.
	4	4	2717	2718	2	10	His garments are rich, but he wears them<br>not handsomely.
	4	4	2719	2721	3	23	He seems to be the more noble in<br>being fantastical. A great man, I’ll warrant. I know<br>by the picking on ’s teeth.
	4	4	2724	2727	4	34	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and<br>box which none must know but the King, and<br>which he shall know within this hour if I may come<br>to th’ speech of him.
	4	4	2729	2729	1	2	Why, sir?
	4	4	2734	2735	2	14	So ’tis said, sir—about his son, that should<br>have married a shepherd’s daughter.
	4	4	2740	2740	1	4	Think you so, sir?
	4	4	2751	2752	2	16	Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you<br>hear, an ’t like you, sir?
	4	4	2770	2775	6	51	He seems to be of<br>great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and<br>though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft<br>led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your<br>purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado.<br>Remember: <span class="quote" data-words="1">stoned,</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="2">flayed alive.</span>
	4	4	2776	2779	4	35	An ’t please you, sir, to<br>undertake the business for us, here is that gold I<br>have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this<br>young man in pawn till I bring it you.
	4	4	2781	2781	1	2	Ay, sir.
	4	4	2784	2785	2	22	In some sort, sir; but though my case<br>be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
	4	4	2788	2794	7	57	Comfort, good comfort.<br>We must to the King, and show our strange<br>sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor<br>my sister. We are gone else.—Sir, I will give you as<br>much as this old man does when the business is<br>performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it<br>be brought you.
	4	4	2798	2799	2	12	We are blessed in this<br>man, as I may say, even blessed.
	4	4	2800	2801	2	13	Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided<br>to do us good.
	5	1	2814	2819	6	45	Sir, you have done enough, and have performed<br>A saintlike sorrow. No fault could you make<br>Which you have not redeemed—indeed, paid down<br>More penitence than done trespass. At the last,<br>Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;<br>With them forgive yourself.
	5	1	2820	2826	7	48	Whilst I remember<br>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget<br>My blemishes in them, and so still think of<br>The wrong I did myself, which was so much<br>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and<br>Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man<br>Bred his hopes out of.
	5	1	2827	2831	5	34	True, too true, my lord.<br>If one by one you wedded all the world,<br>Or from the all that are took something good<br>To make a perfect woman, she you killed<br>Would be unparalleled.
	5	1	2832	2836	5	37	I think so. Killed?<br>She I killed? I did so, but thou strik’st me<br>Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter<br>Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,<br>Say so but seldom.
	5	1	2837	2841	5	25	Not at all, good lady.<br>You might have spoken a thousand things that<br>would<br>Have done the time more benefit and graced<br>Your kindness better.
	5	1	2842	2843	2	10	You are one of those<br>Would have him wed again.
	5	1	2844	2854	11	75	If you would not so,<br>You pity not the state nor the remembrance<br>Of his most sovereign name, consider little<br>What dangers by his Highness’ fail of issue<br>May drop upon his kingdom and devour<br>Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy<br>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?<br>What holier than, for royalty’s repair,<br>For present comfort, and for future good,<br>To bless the bed of majesty again<br>With a sweet fellow to ’t?
	5	1	2855	2870	16	120	There is none worthy,<br>Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods<br>Will have fulfilled their secret purposes.<br>For has not the divine Apollo said,<br>Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle,<br>That King Leontes shall not have an heir<br>Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall<br>Is all as monstrous to our human reason<br>As my Antigonus to break his grave<br>And come again to me—who, on my life,<br>Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel<br>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,<br>Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue.<br>The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander<br>Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor<br>Was like to be the best.
	5	1	2871	2876	6	40	Good Paulina,<br>Who hast the memory of Hermione,<br>I know, in honor, O, that ever I<br>Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now<br>I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes,<br>Have taken treasure from her lips—
	5	1	2877	2878	2	9	And left them<br>More rich for what they yielded.
	5	1	2879	2884	6	39	Thou speak’st truth.<br>No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,<br>And better used, would make her sainted spirit<br>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,<br>Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,<br>And begin <span class="quote" data-words="3">Why to me?</span>
	5	1	2885	2886	2	8	Had she such power,<br>She had just cause.
	5	1	2887	2888	2	11	She had, and would incense me<br>To murder her I married.
	5	1	2889	2894	6	48	I should so.<br>Were I the ghost that walked, I’d bid you mark<br>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t<br>You chose her. Then I’d shriek, that even your ears<br>Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed<br>Should be <span class="quote" data-words="2">Remember mine.</span>
	5	1	2895	2897	3	17	Stars, stars,<br>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;<br>I’ll have no wife, Paulina.
	5	1	2898	2899	2	11	Will you swear<br>Never to marry but by my free leave?
	5	1	2900	2900	1	7	Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit.
	5	1	2901	2901	1	9	Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
	5	1	2902	2902	1	4	You tempt him over-much.
	5	1	2903	2905	3	12	Unless another<br>As like Hermione as is her picture<br>Affront his eye.
	5	1	2906	2906	1	2	Good madam—
	5	1	2907	2914	8	58	I have done.<br>Yet if my lord will marry—if you will, sir,<br>No remedy but you will—give me the office<br>To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young<br>As was your former, but she shall be such<br>As, walked your first queen’s ghost, it should take<br>joy<br>To see her in your arms.
	5	1	2915	2916	2	11	My true Paulina,<br>We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.
	5	1	2917	2919	3	13	That<br>Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath,<br>Never till then.
	5	1	2920	2923	4	26	One that gives out himself Prince Florizell,<br>Son of Polixenes, with his princess—she<br>The fairest I have yet beheld—desires access<br>To your high presence.
	5	1	2924	2928	5	34	What with him? He comes not<br>Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,<br>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us<br>’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced<br>By need and accident. What train?
	5	1	2929	2930	2	6	But few,<br>And those but mean.
	5	1	2931	2931	1	6	His princess, say you, with him?
	5	1	2932	2933	2	16	Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,<br>That e’er the sun shone bright on.
	5	1	2934	2943	10	70	O Hermione,<br>As every present time doth boast itself<br>Above a better gone, so must thy grave<br>Give way to what’s seen now. Sir, you<br>yourself<br>Have said and writ so—but your writing now<br>Is colder than that theme—she had not been<br>Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse<br>Flowed with her beauty once. ’Tis shrewdly ebbed<br>To say you have seen a better.
	5	1	2944	2950	7	48	Pardon, madam.<br>The one I have almost forgot—your pardon;<br>The other, when she has obtained your eye,<br>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,<br>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal<br>Of all professors else, make proselytes<br>Of who she but bid follow.
	5	1	2951	2951	1	3	How, not women?
	5	1	2952	2954	3	23	Women will love her that she is a woman<br>More worth than any man; men, that she is<br>The rarest of all women.
	5	1	2955	2959	5	26	Go, Cleomenes.<br>Yourself, assisted with your honored friends,<br>Bring them to our embracement.<br>Still, ’tis strange<br>He thus should steal upon us.
	5	1	2960	2963	4	25	Had our prince,<br>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired<br>Well with this lord. There was not full a month<br>Between their births.
	5	1	2964	2984	21	156	Prithee, no more; cease. Thou<br>know’st<br>He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,<br>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches<br>Will bring me to consider that which may<br>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.<br>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,<br>For she did print your royal father off,<br>Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,<br>Your father’s image is so hit in you,<br>His very air, that I should call you brother,<br>As I did him, and speak of something wildly<br>By us performed before. Most dearly welcome,<br>And your fair princess—goddess! O, alas,<br>I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and Earth<br>Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as<br>You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost—<br>All mine own folly—the society,<br>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,<br>Though bearing misery, I desire my life<br>Once more to look on him.
	5	1	2985	2995	11	74	By his command<br>Have I here touched Sicilia, and from him<br>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,<br>Can send his brother. And but infirmity,<br>Which waits upon worn times, hath something<br>seized<br>His wished ability, he had himself<br>The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his<br>Measured to look upon you, whom he loves—<br>He bade me say so—more than all the scepters<br>And those that bear them living.
	5	1	2996	3005	10	71	O my brother,<br>Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir<br>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,<br>So rarely kind, are as interpreters<br>Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,<br>As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too<br>Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage,<br>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,<br>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less<br>Th’ adventure of her person?
	5	1	3006	3007	2	7	Good my lord,<br>She came from Libya.
	5	1	3008	3009	2	12	Where the warlike Smalus,<br>That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?
	5	1	3010	3020	11	72	Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose<br>daughter<br>His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,<br>A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed<br>To execute the charge my father gave me<br>For visiting your Highness. My best train<br>I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,<br>Who for Bohemia bend, to signify<br>Not only my success in Libya, sir,<br>But my arrival and my wife’s in safety<br>Here where we are.
	5	1	3021	3031	11	80	The blessèd gods<br>Purge all infection from our air whilst you<br>Do climate here! You have a holy father,<br>A graceful gentleman, against whose person,<br>So sacred as it is, I have done sin,<br>For which the heavens, taking angry note,<br>Have left me issueless. And your father’s blest,<br>As he from heaven merits it, with you,<br>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been<br>Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,<br>Such goodly things as you?
	5	1	3032	3039	8	56	Most noble sir,<br>That which I shall report will bear no credit,<br>Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,<br>Bohemia greets you from himself by me,<br>Desires you to attach his son, who has—<br>His dignity and duty both cast off—<br>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with<br>A shepherd’s daughter.
	5	1	3040	3040	1	3	Where’s Bohemia? Speak.
	5	1	3041	3048	8	59	Here in your city. I now came from him.<br>I speak amazedly, and it becomes<br>My marvel and my message. To your court<br>Whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems,<br>Of this fair couple—meets he on the way<br>The father of this seeming lady and<br>Her brother, having both their country quitted<br>With this young prince.
	5	1	3049	3051	3	14	Camillo has betrayed me,<br>Whose honor and whose honesty till now<br>Endured all weathers.
	5	1	3052	3053	2	12	Lay ’t so to his charge.<br>He’s with the King your father.
	5	1	3054	3054	1	2	Who? Camillo?
	5	1	3055	3060	6	45	Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now<br>Has these poor men in question. Never saw I<br>Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,<br>Forswear themselves as often as they speak.<br>Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them<br>With divers deaths in death.
	5	1	3061	3063	3	16	O my poor father!<br>The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have<br>Our contract celebrated.
	5	1	3064	3064	1	3	You are married?
	5	1	3065	3067	3	26	We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.<br>The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.<br>The odds for high and low’s alike.
	5	1	3068	3069	2	9	My lord,<br>Is this the daughter of a king?
	5	1	3070	3071	2	8	She is<br>When once she is my wife.
	5	1	3072	3077	6	50	That <span class="quote" data-words="1">once,</span> I see, by your good father’s speed<br>Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,<br>Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,<br>Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry<br>Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,<br>That you might well enjoy her.
	5	1	3078	3085	8	58	Dear, look up.<br>Though Fortune, visible an enemy,<br>Should chase us with my father, power no jot<br>Hath she to change our loves.—Beseech you, sir,<br>Remember since you owed no more to time<br>Than I do now. With thought of such affections,<br>Step forth mine advocate. At your request,<br>My father will grant precious things as trifles.
	5	1	3086	3087	2	15	Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,<br>Which he counts but a trifle.
	5	1	3088	3092	5	30	Sir, my liege,<br>Your eye hath too much youth in ’t. Not a month<br>’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such<br>gazes<br>Than what you look on now.
	5	1	3093	3100	8	58	I thought of her<br>Even in these looks I made. But your<br>petition<br>Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.<br>Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires,<br>I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand<br>I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,<br>And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.
	5	2	3103	3108	6	45	I was by at the opening of the fardel,<br>heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he<br>found it, whereupon, after a little amazedness, we<br>were all commanded out of the chamber. Only this,<br>methought, I heard the shepherd say: he found the<br>child.
	5	2	3110	3123	14	115	I make a broken delivery of the<br>business, but the changes I perceived in the King<br>and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They<br>seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear<br>the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their<br>dumbness, language in their very gesture. They<br>looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or<br>one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared<br>in them, but the wisest beholder that knew<br>no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance<br>were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it<br>must needs be.<br>Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.—<br>The news, Rogero?
	5	2	3124	3132	9	78	Nothing but bonfires. The oracle<br>is fulfilled: the King’s daughter is found! Such a<br>deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that<br>ballad makers cannot be able to express it.<br>Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward. He can<br>deliver you more.—How goes it now, sir? This news<br>which is called true is so like an old tale that the<br>verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King<br>found his heir?
	5	2	3133	3143	11	93	Most true, if ever truth were pregnant<br>by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll<br>swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The<br>mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the<br>neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it,<br>which they know to be his character, the majesty of<br>the creature in resemblance of the mother, the<br>affection of nobleness which nature shows above<br>her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim<br>her with all certainty to be the King’s daughter. Did<br>you see the meeting of the two kings?
	5	2	3144	3144	1	1	No.
	5	2	3145	3162	18	154	Then have you lost a sight which<br>was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might<br>you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in<br>such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take<br>leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There<br>was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with<br>countenance of such distraction that they were to<br>be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being<br>ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found<br>daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss,<br>cries <span class="quote" data-words="5">O, thy mother, thy mother!</span> then asks Bohemia<br>forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then<br>again worries he his daughter with clipping her.<br>Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by<br>like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns.<br>I never heard of such another encounter, which<br>lames report to follow it and undoes description to<br>do it.
	5	2	3163	3164	2	11	What, pray you, became of Antigonus,<br>that carried hence the child?
	5	2	3165	3171	7	55	Like an old tale still, which will<br>have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and<br>not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear.<br>This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only<br>his innocence, which seems much, to justify him,<br>but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina<br>knows.
	5	2	3172	3173	2	8	What became of his bark and his<br>followers?
	5	2	3174	3184	11	98	Wracked the same instant of their<br>master’s death and in the view of the shepherd, so<br>that all the instruments which aided to expose the<br>child were even then lost when it was found. But O,<br>the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was<br>fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the<br>loss of her husband, another elevated that the<br>oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the Princess from the<br>earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would<br>pin her to her heart that she might no more be in<br>danger of losing.
	5	2	3185	3187	3	19	The dignity of this act was worth the<br>audience of kings and princes, for by such was it<br>acted.
	5	2	3188	3199	12	101	One of the prettiest touches of all,<br>and that which angled for mine eyes—caught the<br>water, though not the fish—was when at the relation<br>of the Queen’s death—with the manner how<br>she came to ’t bravely confessed and lamented by<br>the King—how attentiveness wounded his daughter,<br>till, from one sign of dolor to another, she did,<br>with an <span class="quote" data-words="1">Alas,</span> I would fain say bleed tears, for I am<br>sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble<br>there changed color; some swooned, all sorrowed.<br>If all the world could have seen ’t, the woe had been<br>universal.
	5	2	3200	3200	1	6	Are they returned to the court?
	5	2	3201	3211	11	93	No. The Princess hearing of her<br>mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of<br>Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now<br>newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio<br>Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could<br>put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of<br>her custom, so perfectly he is her ape; he so near to<br>Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one<br>would speak to her and stand in hope of answer.<br>Thither with all greediness of affection are they<br>gone, and there they intend to sup.
	5	2	3212	3216	5	39	I thought she had some great<br>matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or<br>thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,<br>visited that removed house. Shall we thither and<br>with our company piece the rejoicing?
	5	2	3217	3220	4	31	Who would be thence that has the<br>benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new<br>grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty<br>to our knowledge. Let’s along.
	5	2	3236	3237	2	17	Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy<br>sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.
	5	2	3238	3244	7	61	You are well met, sir.<br>You denied to fight with me this other day because I<br>was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say<br>you see them not and think me still no gentleman<br>born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen<br>born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am<br>not now a gentleman born.
	5	2	3246	3247	2	10	Ay, and have been so any time these<br>four hours.
	5	2	3248	3248	1	5	And so have I, boy.
	5	2	3249	3255	7	64	So you have—but I was a gentleman<br>born before my father. For the King’s son took me<br>by the hand and called me brother, and then the<br>two kings called my father brother, and then the<br>Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called<br>my father father; and so we wept, and there was the<br>first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed.
	5	2	3256	3256	1	8	We may live, son, to shed many more.
	5	2	3257	3258	2	14	Ay, or else ’twere hard luck, being in<br>so preposterous estate as we are.
	5	2	3262	3263	2	12	Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle now<br>we are gentlemen.
	5	2	3264	3265	2	5	Thou wilt amend thy<br>life?
	5	2	3267	3269	3	22	Give me thy hand. I will swear to the<br>Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in<br>Bohemia.
	5	2	3270	3270	1	8	You may say it, but not swear it.
	5	2	3271	3272	2	17	Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?<br>Let boors and franklins say it; I’ll swear it.
	5	2	3273	3273	1	6	How if it be false, son?
	5	2	3274	3280	7	72	If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman<br>may swear it in the behalf of his friend.—And<br>I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy<br>hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know<br>thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou<br>wilt be drunk. But I’ll swear it, and I would thou<br>wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
	5	2	3282	3287	6	50	Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If<br>I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be<br>drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark,<br>the Kings and Princes, our kindred, are going to see<br>the Queen’s picture. Come, follow us. We’ll be thy<br>good masters.
	5	3	3288	3289	2	14	O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort<br>That I have had of thee!
	5	3	3290	3296	7	54	What, sovereign sir,<br>I did not well, I meant well. All my services<br>You have paid home. But that you have vouchsafed,<br>With your crowned brother and these your contracted<br>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,<br>It is a surplus of your grace which never<br>My life may last to answer.
	5	3	3297	3303	7	47	O Paulina,<br>We honor you with trouble. But we came<br>To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery<br>Have we passed through, not without much content<br>In many singularities; but we saw not<br>That which my daughter came to look upon,<br>The statue of her mother.
	5	3	3304	3313	10	86	As she lived peerless,<br>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,<br>Excels whatever yet you looked upon<br>Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it<br>Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare<br>To see the life as lively mocked as ever<br>Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say ’tis well.<br>I like your silence. It the more shows off<br>Your wonder. But yet speak. First you, my liege.<br>Comes it not something near?
	5	3	3314	3320	7	48	Her natural posture!—<br>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed<br>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she<br>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender<br>As infancy and grace.—But yet, Paulina,<br>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing<br>So agèd as this seems.
	5	3	3321	3321	1	4	O, not by much!
	5	3	3322	3324	3	21	So much the more our carver’s excellence,<br>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her<br>As she lived now.
	5	3	3325	3335	11	85	As now she might have done,<br>So much to my good comfort as it is<br>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,<br>Even with such life of majesty—warm life,<br>As now it coldly stands—when first I wooed her.<br>I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me<br>For being more stone than it?—O royal piece,<br>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has<br>My evils conjured to remembrance and<br>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,<br>Standing like stone with thee.
	5	3	3336	3341	6	37	And give me leave,<br>And do not say ’tis superstition, that<br>I kneel, and then implore her blessing.<br>Lady,<br>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,<br>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
	5	3	3342	3344	3	12	O, patience!<br>The statue is but newly fixed; the color’s<br>Not dry.
	5	3	3345	3349	5	34	My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,<br>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,<br>So many summers dry. Scarce any joy<br>Did ever so long live; no sorrow<br>But killed itself much sooner.
	5	3	3350	3353	4	28	Dear my brother,<br>Let him that was the cause of this have power<br>To take off so much grief from you as he<br>Will piece up in himself.
	5	3	3354	3358	5	28	Indeed, my lord,<br>If I had thought the sight of my poor image<br>Would thus have wrought you—for the stone is<br>mine—<br>I’d not have showed it.
	5	3	3359	3359	1	5	Do not draw the curtain.
	5	3	3360	3361	2	15	No longer shall you gaze on ’t, lest your fancy<br>May think anon it moves.
	5	3	3362	3367	6	36	Let be, let be.<br>Would I were dead but that methinks already—<br>What was he that did make it?—See, my lord,<br>Would you not deem it breathed? And that those<br>veins<br>Did verily bear blood?
	5	3	3368	3369	2	10	Masterly done.<br>The very life seems warm upon her lip.
	5	3	3370	3371	2	15	The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,<br>As we are mocked with art.
	5	3	3372	3374	3	16	I’ll draw the curtain.<br>My lord’s almost so far transported that<br>He’ll think anon it lives.
	5	3	3375	3378	4	27	O sweet Paulina,<br>Make me to think so twenty years together!<br>No settled senses of the world can match<br>The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.
	5	3	3379	3380	2	16	I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you, but<br>I could afflict you farther.
	5	3	3381	3386	6	41	Do, Paulina,<br>For this affliction has a taste as sweet<br>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks<br>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel<br>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<br>For I will kiss her.
	5	3	3387	3390	4	29	Good my lord, forbear.<br>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet.<br>You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own<br>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
	5	3	3391	3391	1	5	No, not these twenty years.
	5	3	3392	3393	2	8	So long could I<br>Stand by, a looker-on.
	5	3	3394	3400	7	44	Either forbear,<br>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you<br>For more amazement. If you can behold it,<br>I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend<br>And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think—<br>Which I protest against—I am assisted<br>By wicked powers.
	5	3	3401	3404	4	30	What you can make her do<br>I am content to look on; what to speak,<br>I am content to hear, for ’tis as easy<br>To make her speak as move.
	5	3	3405	3408	4	26	It is required<br>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still—<br>Or those that think it is unlawful business<br>I am about, let them depart.
	5	3	3409	3410	2	5	Proceed.<br>No foot shall stir.
	5	3	3411	3422	12	98	Music, awake her! Strike!<br>’Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more. Approach.<br>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,<br>I’ll fill your grave up. Stir, nay, come away.<br>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<br>Dear life redeems you.—You perceive she stirs.<br>Start not. Her actions shall be holy as<br>You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her<br>Until you see her die again, for then<br>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.<br>When she was young, you wooed her; now in age<br>Is she become the suitor?
	5	3	3423	3425	3	15	O, she’s warm!<br>If this be magic, let it be an art<br>Lawful as eating.
	5	3	3426	3426	1	3	She embraces him.
	5	3	3427	3428	2	14	She hangs about his neck.<br>If she pertain to life, let her speak too.
	5	3	3429	3430	2	15	Ay, and make it manifest where she has lived,<br>Or how stol’n from the dead.
	5	3	3431	3439	9	54	That she is living,<br>Were it but told you, should be hooted at<br>Like an old tale, but it appears she lives,<br>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.<br>Please you to interpose, fair madam.<br>Kneel<br>And pray your mother’s blessing.<br>Turn, good lady.<br>Our Perdita is found.
	5	3	3440	3448	9	57	You gods, look down,<br>And from your sacred vials pour your graces<br>Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,<br>Where hast thou been preserved? Where lived? How<br>found<br>Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,<br>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle<br>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved<br>Myself to see the issue.
	5	3	3449	3456	8	55	There’s time enough for that,<br>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble<br>Your joys with like relation. Go together,<br>You precious winners all. Your exultation<br>Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle,<br>Will wing me to some withered bough and there<br>My mate, that’s never to be found again,<br>Lament till I am lost.
	5	3	3457	3479	23	171	O peace, Paulina.<br>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<br>As I by thine a wife. This is a match,<br>And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found<br>mine—<br>But how is to be questioned, for I saw her,<br>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<br>A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—<br>For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee<br>An honorable husband.—Come, Camillo,<br>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<br>Is richly noted and here justified<br>By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.<br>What, look upon my brother! Both<br>your pardons<br>That e’er I put between your holy looks<br>My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law<br>And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,<br>Is troth-plight to your daughter.—Good Paulina,<br>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<br>Each one demand and answer to his part<br>Performed in this wide gap of time since first<br>We were dissevered. Hastily lead away.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	756	758	3	23	Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice<br>Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer:<br>Yourself, your queen, your son.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	764	770	7	50	If it prove<br>She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where<br>I lodge my wife. I’ll go in couples with her;<br>Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her.<br>For every inch of woman in the world,<br>Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false,<br>If she be.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	773	784	12	91	It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.<br>You are abused, and by some putter-on<br>That will be damned for ’t. Would I knew the<br>villain!<br>I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flawed,<br>I have three daughters—the eldest is eleven;<br>The second and the third, nine and some five;<br>If this prove true, they’ll pay for ’t. By mine honor,<br>I’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see<br>To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,<br>And I had rather glib myself than they<br>Should not produce fair issue.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	790	793	4	26	If it be so,<br>We need no grave to bury honesty.<br>There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten<br>Of the whole dungy Earth.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	809	811	3	17	And I wish, my liege,<br>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,<br>Without more overture.
Antigonus_WT	2	1	841	842	2	12	To laughter, as I take it,<br>If the good truth were known.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1027	1027	1	7	I am none, by this good light.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1062	1064	3	15	Hang all the husbands<br>That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself<br>Hardly one subject.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1100	1102	3	17	I did not, sir.<br>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,<br>Can clear me in ’t.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1125	1129	5	30	Anything, my lord,<br>That my ability may undergo<br>And nobleness impose. At least thus much:<br>I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left<br>To save the innocent. Anything possible.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1132	1132	1	4	I will, my lord.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	1147	1155	9	75	I swear to do this, though a present death<br>Had been more merciful.—Come on, poor babe.<br>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens<br>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,<br>Casting their savageness aside, have done<br>Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous<br>In more than this deed does require.—And blessing<br>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,<br>Poor thing, condemned to loss.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	957	957	1	2	That’s enough.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	975	977	3	18	I told her so, my lord,<br>On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,<br>She should not visit you.
Antigonus_WT	2	3	983	985	3	19	La you now, you hear.<br>When she will take the rein I let her run,<br>But she’ll not stumble.
Antigonus_WT	3	3	1471	1472	2	13	Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon<br>The deserts of Bohemia?
Antigonus_WT	3	3	1478	1480	3	21	Their sacred wills be done. Go, get aboard.<br>Look to thy bark. I’ll not be long before<br>I call upon thee.
Antigonus_WT	3	3	1485	1486	2	6	Go thou away.<br>I’ll follow instantly.
Antigonus_WT	3	3	1489	1525	46	362	Come, poor babe.<br>I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o’ th’ dead<br>May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother<br>Appeared to me last night, for ne’er was dream<br>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,<br>Sometimes her head on one side, some another.<br>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,<br>So filled and so becoming. In pure white robes,<br>Like very sanctity, she did approach<br>My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,<br>And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes<br>Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon<br>Did this break from her: <span class="quote" data-words="66">Good Antigonus,Since fate, against thy better disposition,<br>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<br>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<br>Places remote enough are in Bohemia.<br>There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe<br>Is counted lost forever, Perdita<br>I prithee call ’t. For this ungentle business<br>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see<br>Thy wife Paulina more.</span> And so, with shrieks,<br>She melted into air. Affrighted much,<br>I did in time collect myself and thought<br>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys,<br>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<br>I will be squared by this. I do believe<br>Hermione hath suffered death, and that<br>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue<br>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<br>Either for life or death, upon the earth<br>Of its right father.—Blossom, speed thee well.<br>There lie, and there thy character; there these,<br>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,<br>And still rest thine. The storm begins.<br>Poor wretch,<br>That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed<br>To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,<br>But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I<br>To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.<br>The day frowns more and more. Thou ’rt like to have<br>A lullaby too rough. I never saw<br>The heavens so dim by day.<br>A savage clamor!<br>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase.<br>I am gone forever!
Archidamus_WT	1	1	1	4	4	34	If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia<br>on the like occasion whereon my services<br>are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<br>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
Archidamus_WT	1	1	11	16	6	47	Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my<br>knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in<br>so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you<br>sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our<br>insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as<br>little accuse us.
Archidamus_WT	1	1	19	21	3	17	Believe me, I speak as my understanding<br>instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to<br>utterance.
Archidamus_WT	1	1	34	38	5	39	I think there is not in the world either<br>malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable<br>comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a<br>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came<br>into my note.
Archidamus_WT	1	1	44	44	1	7	Would they else be content to die?
Archidamus_WT	1	1	47	48	2	17	If the King had no son, they would desire<br>to live on crutches till he had one.
Archidamus_WT	1	1	8	9	2	15	Wherein our entertainment shall shame<br>us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed—
Camillo_WT	1	1	10	10	1	2	Beseech you—
Camillo_WT	1	1	17	18	2	11	You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given<br>freely.
Camillo_WT	1	1	22	33	12	89	Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<br>They were trained together in their childhoods,<br>and there rooted betwixt them then such an<br>affection which cannot choose but branch now.<br>Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities<br>made separation of their society, their encounters,<br>though not personal, hath been royally<br>attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<br>embassies, that they have seemed to be together<br>though absent, shook hands as over a vast, and<br>embraced as it were from the ends of opposed<br>winds. The heavens continue their loves.
Camillo_WT	1	1	39	43	5	44	I very well agree with you in the hopes of<br>him. It is a gallant child—one that indeed physics<br>the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went<br>on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to<br>see him a man.
Camillo_WT	1	1	45	46	2	13	Yes, if there were no other excuse why they<br>should desire to live.
Camillo_WT	1	1	5	7	3	20	I think this coming summer the King of<br>Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which<br>he justly owes him.
Camillo_WT	1	2	308	308	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
Camillo_WT	1	2	311	312	2	17	You had much ado to make his anchor hold.<br>When you cast out, it still came home.
Camillo_WT	1	2	314	315	2	12	He would not stay at your petitions, made<br>His business more material.
Camillo_WT	1	2	322	322	1	5	At the good queen’s entreaty.
Camillo_WT	1	2	331	332	2	11	Business, my lord? I think most understand<br>Bohemia stays here longer.
Camillo_WT	1	2	334	334	1	3	Stays here longer.
Camillo_WT	1	2	336	337	2	12	To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties<br>Of our most gracious mistress.
Camillo_WT	1	2	347	347	1	5	Be it forbid, my lord!
Camillo_WT	1	2	358	376	19	133	My gracious lord,<br>I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful.<br>In every one of these no man is free,<br>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,<br>Among the infinite doings of the world,<br>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,<br>If ever I were willful-negligent,<br>It was my folly; if industriously<br>I played the fool, it was my negligence,<br>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful<br>To do a thing where I the issue doubted,<br>Whereof the execution did cry out<br>Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear<br>Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,<br>Are such allowed infirmities that honesty<br>Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,<br>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass<br>By its own visage. If I then deny it,<br>’Tis none of mine.
Camillo_WT	1	2	389	394	6	42	I would not be a stander-by to hear<br>My sovereign mistress clouded so without<br>My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,<br>You never spoke what did become you less<br>Than this, which to reiterate were sin<br>As deep as that, though true.
Camillo_WT	1	2	408	410	3	15	Good my lord, be cured<br>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,<br>For ’tis most dangerous.
Camillo_WT	1	2	412	412	1	4	No, no, my lord.
Camillo_WT	1	2	421	421	1	4	Who does infect her?
Camillo_WT	1	2	434	439	6	45	Sir, my lord,<br>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,<br>But with a ling’ring dram that should not work<br>Maliciously like poison. But I cannot<br>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,<br>So sovereignly being honorable. I have loved thee—
Camillo_WT	1	2	450	456	7	52	I must believe you, sir.<br>I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for ’t—<br>Provided that, when he’s removed, your Highness<br>Will take again your queen as yours at first,<br>Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing<br>The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms<br>Known and allied to yours.
Camillo_WT	1	2	460	465	6	38	My lord,<br>Go then, and with a countenance as clear<br>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia<br>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.<br>If from me he have wholesome beverage,<br>Account me not your servant.
Camillo_WT	1	2	469	469	1	5	I’ll do ’t, my lord.
Camillo_WT	1	2	471	484	14	109	O miserable lady! But, for me,<br>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner<br>Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t<br>Is the obedience to a master, one<br>Who in rebellion with himself will have<br>All that are his so too. To do this deed,<br>Promotion follows. If I could find example<br>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings<br>And flourished after, I’d not do ’t. But since<br>Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears not one,<br>Let villainy itself forswear ’t. I must<br>Forsake the court. To do ’t or no is certain<br>To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!<br>Here comes Bohemia.
Camillo_WT	1	2	488	488	1	4	Hail, most royal sir.
Camillo_WT	1	2	490	490	1	4	None rare, my lord.
Camillo_WT	1	2	499	500	2	6	I dare not know, my<br>lord.
Camillo_WT	1	2	509	512	4	27	There is a sickness<br>Which puts some of us in distemper, but<br>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught<br>Of you that yet are well.
Camillo_WT	1	2	526	526	1	4	I may not answer.
Camillo_WT	1	2	536	541	6	45	Sir, I will tell you,<br>Since I am charged in honor and by him<br>That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,<br>Which must be e’en as swiftly followed as<br>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me<br>Cry lost, and so goodnight.
Camillo_WT	1	2	543	543	1	7	I am appointed him to murder you.
Camillo_WT	1	2	545	545	1	3	By the King.
Camillo_WT	1	2	547	550	4	29	He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears,<br>As he had seen ’t or been an instrument<br>To vice you to ’t, that you have touched his queen<br>Forbiddenly.
Camillo_WT	1	2	559	566	8	55	Swear his thought over<br>By each particular star in heaven and<br>By all their influences, you may as well<br>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon<br>As or by oath remove or counsel shake<br>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation<br>Is piled upon his faith and will continue<br>The standing of his body.
Camillo_WT	1	2	568	583	16	119	I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to<br>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.<br>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,<br>That lies enclosèd in this trunk which you<br>Shall bear along impawned, away tonight!<br>Your followers I will whisper to the business,<br>And will by twos and threes at several posterns<br>Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put<br>My fortunes to your service, which are here<br>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,<br>For, by the honor of my parents, I<br>Have uttered truth—which if you seek to prove,<br>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer<br>Than one condemned by the King’s own mouth,<br>thereon<br>His execution sworn.
Camillo_WT	1	2	601	603	3	24	It is in mine authority to command<br>The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness<br>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
Camillo_WT	4	2	1652	1657	6	58	It is fifteen years since I saw my country.<br>Though I have for the most part been aired abroad,<br>I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent<br>king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling<br>sorrows I might be some allay—or I o’erween to<br>think so—which is another spur to my departure.
Camillo_WT	4	2	1678	1682	5	46	Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.<br>What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown,<br>but I have missingly noted he is of late<br>much retired from court and is less frequent to his<br>princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
Camillo_WT	4	2	1691	1694	4	33	I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a<br>daughter of most rare note. The report of her is<br>extended more than can be thought to begin from<br>such a cottage.
Camillo_WT	4	2	1703	1703	1	5	I willingly obey your command.
Camillo_WT	4	4	1967	1968	2	14	I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,<br>And only live by gazing.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2027	2029	3	20	He tells her something<br>That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is<br>The queen of curds and cream.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2273	2273	1	5	This shows a sound affection.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2368	2369	2	8	Why, how now, father?<br>Speak ere thou diest.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2390	2396	7	50	Gracious my lord,<br>You know your father’s temper. At this time<br>He will allow no speech, which I do guess<br>You do not purpose to him; and as hardly<br>Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.<br>Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,<br>Come not before him.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2399	2399	1	4	Even he, my lord.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2409	2409	1	2	Be advised.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2414	2414	1	4	This is desperate, sir.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2434	2436	3	16	O my lord,<br>I would your spirit were easier for advice<br>Or stronger for your need.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2439	2445	7	48	He’s irremovable,<br>Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if<br>His going I could frame to serve my turn,<br>Save him from danger, do him love and honor,<br>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia<br>And that unhappy king, my master, whom<br>I so much thirst to see.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2449	2451	3	19	Sir, I think<br>You have heard of my poor services i’ th’ love<br>That I have borne your father?
Camillo_WT	4	4	2456	2470	15	102	Well, my<br>lord,<br>If you may please to think I love the King<br>And, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is<br>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,<br>If your more ponderous and settled project<br>May suffer alteration. On mine honor,<br>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving<br>As shall become your Highness, where you may<br>Enjoy your mistress—from the whom I see<br>There’s no disjunction to be made but by,<br>As heavens forfend, your ruin—marry her,<br>And with my best endeavors in your absence,<br>Your discontenting father strive to qualify<br>And bring him up to liking.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2475	2476	2	9	Have you thought on<br>A place whereto you’ll go?
Camillo_WT	4	4	2482	2495	14	107	Then list to me.<br>This follows: if you will not change your purpose<br>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,<br>And there present yourself and your fair princess,<br>For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes.<br>She shall be habited as it becomes<br>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see<br>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping<br>His welcomes forth, asks thee, the son, forgiveness,<br>As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands<br>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him<br>’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one<br>He chides to hell and bids the other grow<br>Faster than thought or time.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2499	2507	9	71	Sent by the King your father<br>To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,<br>The manner of your bearing towards him, with<br>What you, as from your father, shall deliver,<br>Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,<br>The which shall point you forth at every sitting<br>What you must say, that he shall not perceive<br>But that you have your father’s bosom there<br>And speak his very heart.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2510	2521	12	75	A course more promising<br>Than a wild dedication of yourselves<br>To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most<br>certain<br>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,<br>But as you shake off one to take another;<br>Nothing so certain as your anchors, who<br>Do their best office if they can but stay you<br>Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know<br>Prosperity’s the very bond of love,<br>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together<br>Affliction alters.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2525	2528	4	18	Yea, say you so?<br>There shall not at your father’s house these seven<br>years<br>Be born another such.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2532	2534	3	17	I cannot say ’tis pity<br>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress<br>To most that teach.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2543	2548	6	48	My lord,<br>Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes<br>Do all lie there. It shall be so my care<br>To have you royally appointed as if<br>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,<br>That you may know you shall not want, one word.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2573	2574	2	18	Nay, but my letters, by this means being there<br>So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2576	2576	1	4	Shall satisfy your father.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2579	2581	3	16	Who have we here?<br>We’ll make an instrument of this, omit<br>Nothing may give us aid.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2583	2584	2	17	How now, good fellow? Why shak’st thou so?<br>Fear not, man. Here’s no harm intended to thee.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2586	2592	7	56	Why, be so still. Here’s nobody will steal that<br>from thee. Yet for the outside of thy poverty we<br>must make an exchange. Therefore discase thee<br>instantly—thou must think there’s a necessity in<br>’t—and change garments with this gentleman.<br>Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,<br>yet hold thee, there’s some boot.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2595	2596	2	9	Nay, prithee, dispatch. The gentleman is half<br>flayed already.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2602	2610	9	62	Unbuckle, unbuckle.<br>Fortunate mistress—let my prophecy<br>Come home to you!—you must retire yourself<br>Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat<br>And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,<br>Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken<br>The truth of your own seeming, that you may—<br>For I do fear eyes over—to shipboard<br>Get undescried.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2613	2614	2	6	No remedy.—<br>Have you done there?
Camillo_WT	4	4	2617	2618	2	18	Nay, you shall have no hat.<br>Come, lady, come.—Farewell, my friend.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2622	2627	6	45	What I do next shall be to tell the King<br>Of this escape, and whither they are bound;<br>Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail<br>To force him after, in whose company<br>I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight<br>I have a woman’s longing.
Camillo_WT	4	4	2630	2630	1	5	The swifter speed the better.
Camillo_WT	5	3	3345	3349	5	34	My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,<br>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,<br>So many summers dry. Scarce any joy<br>Did ever so long live; no sorrow<br>But killed itself much sooner.
Camillo_WT	5	3	3427	3428	2	14	She hangs about his neck.<br>If she pertain to life, let her speak too.
Chorus_WT	4	1	1616	1648	33	266	I, that please some, try all—both joy and terror<br>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error—<br>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,<br>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime<br>To me or my swift passage that I slide<br>O’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried<br>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power<br>To o’erthrow law and in one self-born hour<br>To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass<br>The same I am ere ancient’st order was<br>Or what is now received. I witness to<br>The times that brought them in. So shall I do<br>To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale<br>The glistering of this present, as my tale<br>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,<br>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing<br>As you had slept between. Leontes leaving,<br>Th’ effects of his fond jealousies so grieving<br>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,<br>Gentle spectators, that I now may be<br>In fair Bohemia. And remember well<br>I mentioned a son o’ th’ King’s, which Florizell<br>I now name to you, and with speed so pace<br>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace<br>Equal with wond’ring. What of her ensues<br>I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news<br>Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s<br>daughter<br>And what to her adheres, which follows after,<br>Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,<br>If ever you have spent time worse ere now.<br>If never, yet that Time himself doth say<br>He wishes earnestly you never may.
Cleomenes_WT	3	1	1175	1177	3	19	The climate’s delicate, the air most sweet,<br>Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing<br>The common praise it bears.
Cleomenes_WT	3	1	1184	1187	4	24	But of all, the burst<br>And the ear-deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle,<br>Kin to Jove’s thunder, so surprised my sense<br>That I was nothing.
Cleomenes_WT	3	1	1192	1195	4	17	Great Apollo<br>Turn all to th’ best! These proclamations,<br>So forcing faults upon Hermione,<br>I little like.
Cleomenes_WT	3	2	1341	1341	1	4	All this we swear.
Cleomenes_WT	5	1	2814	2819	6	45	Sir, you have done enough, and have performed<br>A saintlike sorrow. No fault could you make<br>Which you have not redeemed—indeed, paid down<br>More penitence than done trespass. At the last,<br>Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;<br>With them forgive yourself.
Cleomenes_WT	5	1	2837	2841	5	25	Not at all, good lady.<br>You might have spoken a thousand things that<br>would<br>Have done the time more benefit and graced<br>Your kindness better.
Cleomenes_WT	5	1	2902	2902	1	4	You tempt him over-much.
Cleomenes_WT	5	1	2906	2906	1	2	Good madam—
Dion_WT	3	1	1178	1183	6	37	I shall report,<br>For most it caught me, the celestial habits—<br>Methinks I so should term them—and the reverence<br>Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice,<br>How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly<br>It was i’ th’ off’ring!
Dion_WT	3	1	1188	1191	4	33	If th’ event o’ th’ journey<br>Prove as successful to the Queen—O, be ’t so!—<br>As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,<br>The tune is worth the use on ’t.
Dion_WT	3	1	1196	1201	6	41	The violent carriage of it<br>Will clear or end the business when the oracle,<br>Thus by Apollo’s great divine sealed up,<br>Shall the contents discover. Something rare<br>Even then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses;<br>And gracious be the issue.
Dion_WT	3	2	1341	1341	1	4	All this we swear.
Dion_WT	5	1	2844	2854	11	75	If you would not so,<br>You pity not the state nor the remembrance<br>Of his most sovereign name, consider little<br>What dangers by his Highness’ fail of issue<br>May drop upon his kingdom and devour<br>Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy<br>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?<br>What holier than, for royalty’s repair,<br>For present comfort, and for future good,<br>To bless the bed of majesty again<br>With a sweet fellow to ’t?

Dorcas_WT	4	4	2142	2142	1	6	Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Dorcas_WT	4	4	2158	2158	1	6	Is it true too, think you?
Dorcas_WT	4	4	2171	2171	1	9	We had the tune on ’t a month ago.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1839	1843	5	38	These your unusual weeds to each part of you<br>Does give a life—no shepherdess, but Flora<br>Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing<br>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,<br>And you the queen on ’t.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1854	1856	3	15	I bless the time<br>When my good falcon made her flight across<br>Thy father’s ground.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1866	1877	12	79	Apprehend<br>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,<br>Humbling their deities to love, have taken<br>The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter<br>Became a bull, and bellowed; the green Neptune<br>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,<br>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,<br>As I seem now. Their transformations<br>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,<br>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires<br>Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts<br>Burn hotter than my faith.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1885	1896	12	91	Thou dear’st Perdita,<br>With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not<br>The mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,<br>Or not my father’s. For I cannot be<br>Mine own, nor anything to any, if<br>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,<br>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.<br>Strangle such thoughts as these with anything<br>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming.<br>Lift up your countenance as it were the day<br>Of celebration of that nuptial which<br>We two have sworn shall come.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1899	1901	3	16	See, your guests approach.<br>Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,<br>And let’s be red with mirth.
Florizell_WT	4	4	1991	1991	1	4	What, like a corse?
Florizell_WT	4	4	1999	2010	12	95	What you do<br>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,<br>I’d have you do it ever. When you sing,<br>I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,<br>Pray so; and for the ord’ring your affairs,<br>To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you<br>A wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do<br>Nothing but that, move still, still so,<br>And own no other function. Each your doing,<br>So singular in each particular,<br>Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,<br>That all your acts are queens.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2017	2021	5	36	I think you have<br>As little skill to fear as I have purpose<br>To put you to ’t. But come, our dance, I pray.<br>Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair<br>That never mean to part.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2243	2254	12	84	Old sir, I know<br>She prizes not such trifles as these are.<br>The gifts she looks from me are packed and locked<br>Up in my heart, which I have given already,<br>But not delivered. O, hear me breathe<br>my life<br>Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,<br>Hath sometime loved. I take thy hand, this hand<br>As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,<br>Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fanned snow that’s<br>bolted<br>By th’ northern blasts twice o’er.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2260	2260	1	6	Do, and be witness to ’t.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2262	2271	10	70	And he, and more<br>Than he, and men—the Earth, the heavens, and<br>all—<br>That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,<br>Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth<br>That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge<br>More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them<br>Without her love; for her employ them all,<br>Commend them and condemn them to her service<br>Or to their own perdition.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2284	2288	5	36	O, that must be<br>I’ th’ virtue of your daughter. One being dead,<br>I shall have more than you can dream of yet,<br>Enough then for your wonder. But come on,<br>Contract us fore these witnesses.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2294	2294	1	6	I have, but what of him?
Florizell_WT	4	4	2296	2296	1	5	He neither does nor shall.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2306	2308	3	17	No, good sir.<br>He has his health and ampler strength indeed<br>Than most have of his age.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2316	2319	4	26	I yield all this;<br>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,<br>Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint<br>My father of this business.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2321	2321	1	3	He shall not.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2323	2323	1	4	No, he must not.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2326	2327	2	8	Come, come, he must not.<br>Mark our contract.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2385	2389	5	32	Why look you so upon me?<br>I am but sorry, not afeard; delayed,<br>But nothing altered. What I was, I am,<br>More straining on for plucking back, not following<br>My leash unwillingly.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2397	2398	2	7	I not purpose it.<br>I think Camillo?
Florizell_WT	4	4	2403	2408	6	42	It cannot fail but by<br>The violation of my faith; and then<br>Let nature crush the sides o’ th’ Earth together<br>And mar the seeds within. Lift up thy looks.<br>From my succession wipe me, father. I<br>Am heir to my affection.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2410	2413	4	28	I am, and by my fancy. If my reason<br>Will thereto be obedient, I have reason.<br>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,<br>Do bid it welcome.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2415	2433	19	156	So call it; but it does fulfill my vow.<br>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,<br>Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may<br>Be thereat gleaned, for all the sun sees or<br>The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides<br>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath<br>To this my fair beloved. Therefore, I pray you,<br>As you have ever been my father’s honored friend,<br>When he shall miss me, as in faith I mean not<br>To see him anymore, cast your good counsels<br>Upon his passion. Let myself and fortune<br>Tug for the time to come. This you may know<br>And so deliver: I am put to sea<br>With her who here I cannot hold on shore.<br>And most opportune to our need I have<br>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared<br>For this design. What course I mean to hold<br>Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor<br>Concern me the reporting.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2437	2438	2	8	Hark, Perdita.—<br>I’ll hear you by and by.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2446	2448	3	15	Now, good Camillo,<br>I am so fraught with curious business that<br>I leave out ceremony.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2452	2455	4	26	Very nobly<br>Have you deserved. It is my father’s music<br>To speak your deeds, not little of his care<br>To have them recompensed as thought on.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2471	2474	4	24	How, Camillo,<br>May this, almost a miracle, be done,<br>That I may call thee something more than man,<br>And after that trust to thee?
Florizell_WT	4	4	2477	2481	5	32	Not any yet.<br>But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty<br>To what we wildly do, so we profess<br>Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies<br>Of every wind that blows.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2496	2498	3	13	Worthy Camillo,<br>What color for my visitation shall I<br>Hold up before him?
Florizell_WT	4	4	2508	2509	2	11	I am bound to you.<br>There is some sap in this.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2529	2531	3	17	My good Camillo,<br>She’s as forward of her breeding as she is<br>I’ th’ rear our birth.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2537	2542	6	39	My prettiest Perdita.<br>But O, the thorns we stand upon!—Camillo,<br>Preserver of my father, now of me,<br>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?<br>We are not furnished like Bohemia’s son,<br>Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2575	2575	1	8	And those that you’ll procure from King Leontes—
Florizell_WT	4	4	2599	2599	1	3	Dispatch, I prithee.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2615	2616	2	12	Should I now meet my father,<br>He would not call me son.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2620	2621	2	11	O Perdita, what have we twain forgot?<br>Pray you, a word.
Florizell_WT	4	4	2628	2629	2	11	Fortune speed us!—<br>Thus we set on, Camillo, to th’ seaside.
Florizell_WT	5	1	2985	2995	11	74	By his command<br>Have I here touched Sicilia, and from him<br>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,<br>Can send his brother. And but infirmity,<br>Which waits upon worn times, hath something<br>seized<br>His wished ability, he had himself<br>The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his<br>Measured to look upon you, whom he loves—<br>He bade me say so—more than all the scepters<br>And those that bear them living.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3006	3007	2	7	Good my lord,<br>She came from Libya.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3010	3020	11	72	Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose<br>daughter<br>His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,<br>A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed<br>To execute the charge my father gave me<br>For visiting your Highness. My best train<br>I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,<br>Who for Bohemia bend, to signify<br>Not only my success in Libya, sir,<br>But my arrival and my wife’s in safety<br>Here where we are.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3049	3051	3	14	Camillo has betrayed me,<br>Whose honor and whose honesty till now<br>Endured all weathers.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3065	3067	3	26	We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.<br>The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.<br>The odds for high and low’s alike.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3070	3071	2	8	She is<br>When once she is my wife.
Florizell_WT	5	1	3078	3085	8	58	Dear, look up.<br>Though Fortune, visible an enemy,<br>Should chase us with my father, power no jot<br>Hath she to change our loves.—Beseech you, sir,<br>Remember since you owed no more to time<br>Than I do now. With thought of such affections,<br>Step forth mine advocate. At your request,<br>My father will grant precious things as trifles.
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3103	3108	6	45	I was by at the opening of the fardel,<br>heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he<br>found it, whereupon, after a little amazedness, we<br>were all commanded out of the chamber. Only this,<br>methought, I heard the shepherd say: he found the<br>child.
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3110	3123	14	115	I make a broken delivery of the<br>business, but the changes I perceived in the King<br>and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They<br>seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear<br>the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their<br>dumbness, language in their very gesture. They<br>looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or<br>one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared<br>in them, but the wisest beholder that knew<br>no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance<br>were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it<br>must needs be.<br>Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.—<br>The news, Rogero?
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3172	3173	2	8	What became of his bark and his<br>followers?
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3185	3187	3	19	The dignity of this act was worth the<br>audience of kings and princes, for by such was it<br>acted.
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3200	3200	1	6	Are they returned to the court?
GENTLEMEN.1_WT	5	2	3217	3220	4	31	Who would be thence that has the<br>benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new<br>grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty<br>to our knowledge. Let’s along.
GENTLEMEN.2_WT	5	2	3124	3132	9	78	Nothing but bonfires. The oracle<br>is fulfilled: the King’s daughter is found! Such a<br>deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that<br>ballad makers cannot be able to express it.<br>Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward. He can<br>deliver you more.—How goes it now, sir? This news<br>which is called true is so like an old tale that the<br>verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King<br>found his heir?
GENTLEMEN.2_WT	5	2	3144	3144	1	1	No.
GENTLEMEN.2_WT	5	2	3163	3164	2	11	What, pray you, became of Antigonus,<br>that carried hence the child?
GENTLEMEN.2_WT	5	2	3212	3216	5	39	I thought she had some great<br>matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or<br>thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,<br>visited that removed house. Shall we thither and<br>with our company piece the rejoicing?
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3133	3143	11	93	Most true, if ever truth were pregnant<br>by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll<br>swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The<br>mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the<br>neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it,<br>which they know to be his character, the majesty of<br>the creature in resemblance of the mother, the<br>affection of nobleness which nature shows above<br>her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim<br>her with all certainty to be the King’s daughter. Did<br>you see the meeting of the two kings?
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3145	3162	18	154	Then have you lost a sight which<br>was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might<br>you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in<br>such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take<br>leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There<br>was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with<br>countenance of such distraction that they were to<br>be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being<br>ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found<br>daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss,<br>cries <span class="quote" data-words="5">O, thy mother, thy mother!</span> then asks Bohemia<br>forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then<br>again worries he his daughter with clipping her.<br>Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by<br>like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns.<br>I never heard of such another encounter, which<br>lames report to follow it and undoes description to<br>do it.
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3165	3171	7	55	Like an old tale still, which will<br>have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and<br>not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear.<br>This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only<br>his innocence, which seems much, to justify him,<br>but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina<br>knows.
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3174	3184	11	98	Wracked the same instant of their<br>master’s death and in the view of the shepherd, so<br>that all the instruments which aided to expose the<br>child were even then lost when it was found. But O,<br>the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was<br>fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the<br>loss of her husband, another elevated that the<br>oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the Princess from the<br>earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would<br>pin her to her heart that she might no more be in<br>danger of losing.
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3188	3199	12	101	One of the prettiest touches of all,<br>and that which angled for mine eyes—caught the<br>water, though not the fish—was when at the relation<br>of the Queen’s death—with the manner how<br>she came to ’t bravely confessed and lamented by<br>the King—how attentiveness wounded his daughter,<br>till, from one sign of dolor to another, she did,<br>with an <span class="quote" data-words="1">Alas,</span> I would fain say bleed tears, for I am<br>sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble<br>there changed color; some swooned, all sorrowed.<br>If all the world could have seen ’t, the woe had been<br>universal.
GENTLEMEN.3_WT	5	2	3201	3211	11	93	No. The Princess hearing of her<br>mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of<br>Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now<br>newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio<br>Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could<br>put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of<br>her custom, so perfectly he is her ape; he so near to<br>Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one<br>would speak to her and stand in hope of answer.<br>Thither with all greediness of affection are they<br>gone, and there they intend to sup.
Hermione_WT	1	2	105	105	1	4	Nay, but you will?
Hermione_WT	1	2	107	118	12	87	Verily?<br>You put me off with limber vows. But I,<br>Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with<br>oaths,<br>Should yet say <span class="quote" data-words="3">Sir, no going.</span> Verily,<br>You shall not go. A lady’s <span class="quote" data-words="1">verily</span> is<br>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?<br>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,<br>Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees<br>When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?<br>My prisoner or my guest? By your dread <span class="quote" data-words="1">verily,</span><br>One of them you shall be.
Hermione_WT	1	2	123	126	4	27	Not your jailer, then,<br>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you<br>Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.<br>You were pretty lordings then?
Hermione_WT	1	2	131	132	2	10	Was not my lord<br>The verier wag o’ th’ two?
Hermione_WT	1	2	143	144	2	8	By this we gather<br>You have tripped since.
Hermione_WT	1	2	150	156	7	53	Grace to boot!<br>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say<br>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.<br>Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,<br>If you first sinned with us, and that with us<br>You did continue fault, and that you slipped not<br>With any but with us.
Hermione_WT	1	2	158	158	1	4	He’ll stay, my lord.
Hermione_WT	1	2	162	162	1	1	Never?
Hermione_WT	1	2	164	176	13	108	What, have I twice said well? When was ’t before?<br>I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s<br>As fat as tame things. One good deed dying<br>tongueless<br>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.<br>Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s<br>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere<br>With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:<br>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.<br>What was my first? It has an elder sister,<br>Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!<br>But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?<br>Nay, let me have ’t; I long.
Hermione_WT	1	2	183	186	4	28	’Tis grace indeed.<br>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.<br>The one forever earned a royal husband,<br>Th’ other for some while a friend.
Hermione_WT	1	2	233	233	1	4	He something seems unsettled.
Hermione_WT	1	2	236	238	3	16	You look<br>As if you held a brow of much distraction.<br>Are you moved, my lord?
Hermione_WT	1	2	270	271	2	16	If you would seek us,<br>We are yours i’ th’ garden. Shall ’s attend you there?
Hermione_WT	1	2	85	90	6	50	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until<br>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,<br>Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure<br>All in Bohemia’s well. This satisfaction<br>The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him,<br>He’s beat from his best ward.
Hermione_WT	1	2	92	103	12	96	To tell he longs to see his son were strong.<br>But let him say so then, and let him go.<br>But let him swear so and he shall not stay;<br>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.<br>Yet of your royal presence I’ll<br>adventure<br>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia<br>You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission<br>To let him there a month behind the gest<br>Prefixed for ’s parting.—Yet, good deed, Leontes,<br>I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind<br>What lady she her lord.—You’ll stay?
Hermione_WT	2	1	604	605	2	12	Take the boy to you. He so troubles me<br>’Tis past enduring.
Hermione_WT	2	1	631	633	3	23	What wisdom stirs amongst you?—Come, sir, now<br>I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,<br>And tell ’s a tale.
Hermione_WT	2	1	635	635	1	5	As merry as you will.
Hermione_WT	2	1	638	640	3	25	Let’s have that, good sir.<br>Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best<br>To fright me with your sprites. You’re powerful at it.
Hermione_WT	2	1	642	642	1	6	Nay, come sit down, then on.
Hermione_WT	2	1	645	645	1	10	Come on then, and give ’t me in mine ear.
Hermione_WT	2	1	676	676	1	4	What is this? Sport?
Hermione_WT	2	1	682	684	3	21	But I’d say he had not,<br>And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,<br>Howe’er you lean to th’ nayward.
Hermione_WT	2	1	701	704	4	24	Should a villain say so,<br>The most replenished villain in the world,<br>He were as much more villain. You, my lord,<br>Do but mistake.
Hermione_WT	2	1	720	725	6	42	No, by my life,<br>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,<br>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<br>You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,<br>You scarce can right me throughly then to say<br>You did mistake.
Hermione_WT	2	1	732	742	11	82	There’s some ill planet reigns.<br>I must be patient till the heavens look<br>With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,<br>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<br>Commonly are, the want of which vain dew<br>Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have<br>That honorable grief lodged here which burns<br>Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,<br>With thoughts so qualified as your charities<br>Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>The King’s will be performed.
Hermione_WT	2	1	744	753	10	81	Who is ’t that goes with me? Beseech your Highness<br>My women may be with me, for you see<br>My plight requires it.—Do not weep, good fools;<br>There is no cause. When you shall know your<br>mistress<br>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<br>As I come out. This action I now go on<br>Is for my better grace.—Adieu, my lord.<br>I never wished to see you sorry; now<br>I trust I shall.—My women, come; you have leave.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1224	1256	33	263	Since what I am to say must be but that<br>Which contradicts my accusation, and<br>The testimony on my part no other<br>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me<br>To say <span class="quote" data-words="2">Not guilty.</span> Mine integrity,<br>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<br>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<br>Behold our human actions, as they do,<br>I doubt not then but innocence shall make<br>False accusation blush and tyranny<br>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<br>Whom least will seem to do so, my past life<br>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>As I am now unhappy; which is more<br>Than history can pattern, though devised<br>And played to take spectators. For behold me,<br>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe<br>A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,<br>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<br>To prate and talk for life and honor fore<br>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<br>As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor,<br>’Tis a derivative from me to mine,<br>And only that I stand for. I appeal<br>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<br>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<br>How merited to be so; since he came,<br>With what encounter so uncurrent I<br>Have strained t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond<br>The bound of honor, or in act or will<br>That way inclining, hardened be the hearts<br>Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin<br>Cry fie upon my grave.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1261	1262	2	12	That’s true enough,<br>Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1264	1282	19	145	More than mistress of<br>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not<br>At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,<br>With whom I am accused, I do confess<br>I loved him as in honor he required,<br>With such a kind of love as might become<br>A lady like me, with a love even such,<br>So and no other, as yourself commanded,<br>Which not to have done, I think, had been in me<br>Both disobedience and ingratitude<br>To you and toward your friend, whose love had<br>spoke,<br>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely<br>That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,<br>I know not how it tastes, though it be dished<br>For me to try how. All I know of it<br>Is that Camillo was an honest man;<br>And why he left your court, the gods themselves,<br>Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1285	1288	4	22	Sir,<br>You speak a language that I understand not.<br>My life stands in the level of your dreams,<br>Which I’ll lay down.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1299	1324	26	204	Sir, spare your threats.<br>The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<br>To me can life be no commodity.<br>The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,<br>I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,<br>But know not how it went. My second joy<br>And first fruits of my body, from his presence<br>I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,<br>Starred most unluckily, is from my breast,<br>The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth,<br>Haled out to murder; myself on every post<br>Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred<br>The childbed privilege denied, which longs<br>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<br>Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before<br>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<br>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<br>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<br>But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life,<br>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,<br>Which I would free), if I shall be condemned<br>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else<br>But what your jealousies awake, I tell you<br>’Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all,<br>I do refer me to the oracle.<br>Apollo be my judge.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1328	1332	5	35	The Emperor of Russia was my father.<br>O, that he were alive and here beholding<br>His daughter’s trial, that he did but see<br>The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes<br>Of pity, not revenge.
Hermione_WT	3	2	1349	1349	1	1	Praised!
Hermione_WT	5	3	3440	3448	9	57	You gods, look down,<br>And from your sacred vials pour your graces<br>Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,<br>Where hast thou been preserved? Where lived? How<br>found<br>Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,<br>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle<br>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved<br>Myself to see the issue.
Jailer_WT	2	2	850	851	2	10	For a worthy lady<br>And one who much I honor.
Jailer_WT	2	2	854	855	2	11	I may not, madam.<br>To the contrary I have express commandment.
Jailer_WT	2	2	859	861	3	15	So please you, madam,<br>To put apart these your attendants, I<br>Shall bring Emilia forth.
Jailer_WT	2	2	864	864	1	9	And, madam, I must be present at your conference.
Jailer_WT	2	2	911	913	3	23	Madam, if ’t please the Queen to send the babe,<br>I know not what I shall incur to pass it,<br>Having no warrant.
Jailer_WT	2	2	920	920	1	4	I do believe it.
LADIES.0.1_WT	2	1	606	607	2	9	Come, my gracious lord,<br>Shall I be your playfellow?
LADIES.0.1_WT	2	1	609	609	1	4	Why, my sweet lord?
LADIES.0.1_WT	2	1	621	621	1	3	Blue, my lord.
LADIES.0.1_WT	2	1	624	628	5	33	Hark ye,<br>The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall<br>Present our services to a fine new prince<br>One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us<br>If we would have you.
LADIES.0.2_WT	2	1	612	612	1	5	And why so, my lord?
LADIES.0.2_WT	2	1	618	618	1	3	Who taught this?
LADIES.0.2_WT	2	1	629	630	2	13	She is spread of late<br>Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!
LADIES.Emilia_WT	2	2	870	873	4	31	As well as one so great and so forlorn<br>May hold together. On her frights and griefs,<br>Which never tender lady hath borne greater,<br>She is something before her time delivered.
LADIES.Emilia_WT	2	2	875	877	4	27	A daughter, and a goodly babe,<br>Lusty and like to live. The Queen receives<br>Much comfort in ’t, says <span class="quote" data-words="8">My poor prisoner,I am innocent as you.</span>
LADIES.Emilia_WT	2	2	894	903	10	69	Most worthy madam,<br>Your honor and your goodness is so evident<br>That your free undertaking cannot miss<br>A thriving issue. There is no lady living<br>So meet for this great errand. Please your Ladyship<br>To visit the next room, I’ll presently<br>Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer,<br>Who but today hammered of this design,<br>But durst not tempt a minister of honor<br>Lest she should be denied.
LADIES.Emilia_WT	2	2	908	910	3	15	Now be you blest for it!<br>I’ll to the Queen. Please you come something<br>nearer.
Leontes_WT	1	2	157	157	1	4	Is he won yet?
Leontes_WT	1	2	159	161	3	15	At my request he would not.<br>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st<br>To better purpose.
Leontes_WT	1	2	163	163	1	3	Never but once.
Leontes_WT	1	2	177	182	6	34	Why, that was when<br>Three crabbèd months had soured themselves to<br>death<br>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand<br>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">I am yours forever.</span>
Leontes_WT	1	2	187	199	13	100	Too hot, too hot!<br>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.<br>I have <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">tremor cordis</span> on me. My heart dances,<br>But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment<br>May a free face put on, derive a liberty<br>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,<br>And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.<br>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,<br>As now they are, and making practiced smiles<br>As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere<br>The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment<br>My bosom likes not, nor my brows.—Mamillius,<br>Art thou my boy?
Leontes_WT	1	2	201	209	9	58	I’ fecks!<br>Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy<br>nose?<br>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,<br>We must be neat—not neat, but cleanly, captain.<br>And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf<br>Are all called neat.—Still virginalling<br>Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf?<br>Art thou my calf?
Leontes_WT	1	2	211	231	21	157	Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I<br>have<br>To be full like me; yet they say we are<br>Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,<br>That will say anything. But were they false<br>As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false<br>As dice are to be wished by one that fixes<br>No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true<br>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,<br>Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,<br>Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?—may ’t<br>be?—<br>Affection, thy intention stabs the center.<br>Thou dost make possible things not so held,<br>Communicat’st with dreams—how can this be?<br>With what’s unreal thou coactive art,<br>And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent<br>Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,<br>And that beyond commission, and I find it,<br>And that to the infection of my brains<br>And hard’ning of my brows.
Leontes_WT	1	2	235	235	1	9	What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother?
Leontes_WT	1	2	239	250	12	84	No, in good earnest.<br>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,<br>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime<br>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines<br>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil<br>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,<br>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled<br>Lest it should bite its master and so prove,<br>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.<br>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,<br>This squash, this gentleman.—Mine honest friend,<br>Will you take eggs for money?
Leontes_WT	1	2	252	254	3	26	You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!—My brother,<br>Are you so fond of your young prince as we<br>Do seem to be of ours?
Leontes_WT	1	2	262	269	8	50	So stands this<br>squire<br>Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,<br>And leave you to your graver steps.—Hermione,<br>How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome.<br>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.<br>Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s<br>Apparent to my heart.
Leontes_WT	1	2	272	304	33	258	To your own bents dispose you. You’ll be found,<br>Be you beneath the sky. I am angling now,<br>Though you perceive me not how I give line.<br>Go to, go to!<br>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him,<br>And arms her with the boldness of a wife<br>To her allowing husband!<br>Gone already.<br>Inch thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked<br>one!—<br>Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I<br>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue<br>Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor<br>Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.—There have<br>been,<br>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;<br>And many a man there is, even at this present,<br>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,<br>That little thinks she has been sluiced in ’s absence,<br>And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by<br>Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t<br>Whiles other men have gates and those gates<br>opened,<br>As mine, against their will. Should all despair<br>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind<br>Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there’s none.<br>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike<br>Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,<br>From east, west, north, and south.

Leontes_WT	1	2	306	307	2	7	Why, that’s some comfort.—<br>What, Camillo there?
Leontes_WT	1	2	309	310	2	18	Go play, Mamillius. Thou ’rt an honest man.<br>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
Leontes_WT	1	2	313	313	1	3	Didst note it?
Leontes_WT	1	2	316	321	6	32	Didst perceive it?<br>They’re here with me already, whisp’ring,<br>rounding:<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Sicilia is a so-forth.</span> ’Tis far gone<br>When I shall gust it last.—How came ’t, Camillo,<br>That he did stay?

Leontes_WT	1	2	335	335	1	3	Ay, but why?
Leontes_WT	1	2	338	346	9	55	Satisfy?<br>Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?<br>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,<br>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well<br>My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou<br>Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed<br>Thy penitent reformed. But we have been<br>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived<br>In that which seems so.
Leontes_WT	1	2	348	357	10	62	To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,<br>If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,<br>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining<br>From course required; or else thou must be<br>counted<br>A servant grafted in my serious trust<br>And therein negligent; or else a fool<br>That seest a game played home, the rich stake<br>drawn,<br>And tak’st it all for jest.
Leontes_WT	1	2	377	388	12	91	Ha’ not you seen, Camillo—<br>But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass<br>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn—or heard—<br>For to a vision so apparent, rumor<br>Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation<br>Resides not in that man that does not think—<br>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess—<br>Or else be impudently negative<br>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought—then say<br>My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name<br>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to<br>Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.
Leontes_WT	1	2	395	407	13	96	Is whispering nothing?<br>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?<br>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career<br>Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible<br>Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?<br>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?<br>Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes<br>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,<br>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?<br>Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing,<br>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,<br>My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,<br>If this be nothing.
Leontes_WT	1	2	411	411	1	5	Say it be, ’tis true.
Leontes_WT	1	2	413	420	8	60	It is. You lie, you lie.<br>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,<br>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,<br>Or else a hovering temporizer that<br>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,<br>Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver<br>Infected as her life, she would not live<br>The running of one glass.
Leontes_WT	1	2	422	433	12	94	Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging<br>About his neck—Bohemia, who, if I<br>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes<br>To see alike mine honor as their profits,<br>Their own particular thrifts, they would do that<br>Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,<br>His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form<br>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see<br>Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven<br>How I am galled—mightst bespice a cup<br>To give mine enemy a lasting wink,<br>Which draft to me were cordial.
Leontes_WT	1	2	440	449	10	77	Make that thy question, and go rot!<br>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,<br>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully<br>The purity and whiteness of my sheets—<br>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted<br>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps—<br>Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince, my son,<br>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,<br>Without ripe moving to ’t? Would I do this?<br>Could man so blench?
Leontes_WT	1	2	457	459	3	22	Thou dost advise me<br>Even so as I mine own course have set down.<br>I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.
Leontes_WT	1	2	466	468	3	21	This is all.<br>Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;<br>Do ’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.
Leontes_WT	1	2	470	470	1	9	I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
Leontes_WT	1	2	58	59	2	10	Stay your thanks awhile,<br>And pay them when you part.
Leontes_WT	1	2	66	67	2	11	We are tougher, brother,<br>Than you can put us to ’t.
Leontes_WT	1	2	69	69	1	3	One sev’nnight longer.
Leontes_WT	1	2	71	72	2	13	We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that<br>I’ll no gainsaying.
Leontes_WT	1	2	83	84	2	5	Tongue-tied, our queen?<br>Speak you.
Leontes_WT	1	2	91	91	1	3	Well said, Hermione.
Leontes_WT	2	1	646	646	1	9	Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?
Leontes_WT	2	1	650	667	18	139	How blest am I<br>In my just censure, in my true opinion!<br>Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed<br>In being so blest! There may be in the cup<br>A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,<br>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge<br>Is not infected; but if one present<br>Th’ abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known<br>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,<br>With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.<br>Camillo was his help in this, his pander.<br>There is a plot against my life, my crown.<br>All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain<br>Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.<br>He has discovered my design, and I<br>Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick<br>For them to play at will. How came the posterns<br>So easily open?
Leontes_WT	2	1	671	675	5	35	I know ’t too well.<br>Give me the boy. I am glad you did<br>not nurse him.<br>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you<br>Have too much blood in him.
Leontes_WT	2	1	677	681	5	33	Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.<br>Away with him, and let her sport herself<br>With that she’s big with, for ’tis<br>Polixenes<br>Has made thee swell thus.
Leontes_WT	2	1	685	700	16	115	You, my lords,<br>Look on her, mark her well. Be but about<br>To say <span class="quote" data-words="5">She is a goodly lady,</span> and<br>The justice of your hearts will thereto add<br><span class="quote" data-words="6">’Tis pity she’s not honest, honorable.</span><br>Praise her but for this her without-door form,<br>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and<br>straight<br>The shrug, the <span class="quote" data-words="1">hum,</span> or <span class="quote" data-words="1">ha,</span> these petty brands<br>That calumny doth use—O, I am out,<br>That mercy does, for calumny will sear<br>Virtue itself—these shrugs, these <span class="" data-words="0"><span class="quote" data-words="0">hum</span></span>s and <span class="" data-words="0"><span class="quote" data-words="0">ha</span></span>s,<br>When you have said she’s goodly, come between<br>Ere you can say she’s honest. But be ’t known,<br>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,<br>She’s an adult’ress.
Leontes_WT	2	1	705	719	15	105	You have mistook, my lady,<br>Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,<br>Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place<br>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,<br>Should a like language use to all degrees,<br>And mannerly distinguishment leave out<br>Betwixt the prince and beggar.—I have said<br>She’s an adult’ress; I have said with whom.<br>More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is<br>A federary with her, and one that knows<br>What she should shame to know herself<br>But with her most vile principal: that she’s<br>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those<br>That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy<br>To this their late escape.
Leontes_WT	2	1	726	731	6	41	No. If I mistake<br>In those foundations which I build upon,<br>The center is not big enough to bear<br>A schoolboy’s top.—Away with her to prison.<br>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty<br>But that he speaks.
Leontes_WT	2	1	743	743	1	4	Shall I be heard?
Leontes_WT	2	1	754	754	1	5	Go, do our bidding. Hence!
Leontes_WT	2	1	771	771	1	3	Hold your peaces.
Leontes_WT	2	1	785	789	5	38	Cease. No more.<br>You smell this business with a sense as cold<br>As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see ’t and feel ’t,<br>As you feel doing thus, and see withal<br>The instruments that feel.
Leontes_WT	2	1	794	794	1	4	What? Lack I credit?
Leontes_WT	2	1	799	808	10	69	Why, what need we<br>Commune with you of this, but rather follow<br>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative<br>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness<br>Imparts this, which if you—or stupefied<br>Or seeming so in skill—cannot or will not<br>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves<br>We need no more of your advice. The matter,<br>The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on ’t is all<br>Properly ours.
Leontes_WT	2	1	812	828	17	113	How could that be?<br>Either thou art most ignorant by age,<br>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,<br>Added to their familiarity—<br>Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,<br>That lacked sight only, naught for approbation<br>But only seeing, all other circumstances<br>Made up to th’ deed—doth push on this<br>proceeding.<br>Yet, for a greater confirmation—<br>For in an act of this importance ’twere<br>Most piteous to be wild—I have dispatched in post<br>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,<br>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know<br>Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle<br>They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had<br>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
Leontes_WT	2	1	831	840	10	80	Though I am satisfied and need no more<br>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle<br>Give rest to th’ minds of others, such as he<br>Whose ignorant credulity will not<br>Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good<br>From our free person she should be confined,<br>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence<br>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.<br>We are to speak in public, for this business<br>Will raise us all.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1005	1007	3	14	Out!<br>A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door.<br>A most intelligencing bawd.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1013	1018	6	38	Traitors,<br>Will you not push her out? Give her<br>the bastard,<br>Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted<br>By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,<br>Take ’t up, I say. Give ’t to thy crone.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1023	1023	1	4	He dreads his wife.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1026	1026	1	4	A nest of traitors!
Leontes_WT	2	3	1038	1044	7	40	A callet<br>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her<br>husband<br>And now baits me! This brat is none of mine.<br>It is the issue of Polixenes.<br>Hence with it, and together with the dam<br>Commit them to the fire.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1059	1061	3	17	A gross hag!—<br>And, losel, thou art worthy to be hanged<br>That wilt not stay her tongue.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1065	1065	1	5	Once more, take her hence.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1068	1068	1	4	I’ll ha’ thee burnt.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1078	1081	4	32	On your allegiance,<br>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,<br>Where were her life? She durst not call me so<br>If she did know me one. Away with her!
Leontes_WT	2	3	1088	1099	12	102	Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.<br>My child? Away with ’t! Even thou, that hast<br>A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,<br>And see it instantly consumed with fire.<br>Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.<br>Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,<br>And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,<br>With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse<br>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so.<br>The bastard brains with these my proper hands<br>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,<br>For thou sett’st on thy wife.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1105	1105	1	3	You’re liars all.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1113	1124	12	84	I am a feather for each wind that blows.<br>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel<br>And call me father? Better burn it now<br>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.<br>It shall not neither. You, sir, come<br>you hither,<br>You that have been so tenderly officious<br>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,<br>To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,<br>So sure as this beard’s gray. What will you<br>adventure<br>To save this brat’s life?
Leontes_WT	2	3	1130	1131	2	13	It shall be possible. Swear by this sword<br>Thou wilt perform my bidding.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1133	1146	14	122	Mark, and perform it, seest thou; for the fail<br>Of any point in ’t shall not only be<br>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,<br>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,<br>As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry<br>This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it<br>To some remote and desert place quite out<br>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,<br>Without more mercy, to it own protection<br>And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune<br>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,<br>On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,<br>That thou commend it strangely to some place<br>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1156	1157	2	6	No, I’ll not rear<br>Another’s issue.
Leontes_WT	2	3	1165	1174	10	69	Twenty-three days<br>They have been absent. ’Tis good speed, foretells<br>The great Apollo suddenly will have<br>The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.<br>Summon a session, that we may arraign<br>Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath<br>Been publicly accused, so shall she have<br>A just and open trial. While she lives,<br>My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,<br>And think upon my bidding.
Leontes_WT	2	3	923	931	9	78	Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness<br>To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If<br>The cause were not in being—part o’ th’ cause,<br>She th’ adult’ress, for the harlot king<br>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank<br>And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she<br>I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,<br>Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest<br>Might come to me again.—Who’s there?
Leontes_WT	2	3	933	933	1	4	How does the boy?
Leontes_WT	2	3	936	951	16	116	To see his nobleness,<br>Conceiving the dishonor of his mother.<br>He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,<br>Fastened and fixed the shame on ’t in himself,<br>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,<br>And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,<br>See how he fares.<br>Fie, fie, no thought of him.<br>The very thought of my revenges that way<br>Recoil upon me—in himself too mighty,<br>And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be<br>Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,<br>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes<br>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.<br>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor<br>Shall she within my power.
Leontes_WT	2	3	968	968	1	4	What noise there, ho?
Leontes_WT	2	3	971	974	4	21	How?—<br>Away with that audacious lady. Antigonus,<br>I charged thee that she should not come about me.<br>I knew she would.
Leontes_WT	2	3	978	978	1	5	What, canst not rule her?
Leontes_WT	2	3	993	993	1	2	Good queen?
Leontes_WT	2	3	998	998	1	3	Force her hence.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1202	1209	8	59	This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,<br>Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried<br>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one<br>Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared<br>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly<br>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course<br>Even to the guilt or the purgation.<br>Produce the prisoner.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1213	1213	1	3	Read the indictment.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1257	1260	4	23	I ne’er heard yet<br>That any of these bolder vices wanted<br>Less impudence to gainsay what they did<br>Than to perform it first.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1263	1263	1	5	You will not own it.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1283	1284	2	17	You knew of his departure, as you know<br>What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1289	1298	10	79	Your actions are my dreams.<br>You had a bastard by Polixenes,<br>And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame—<br>Those of your fact are so—so past all truth,<br>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as<br>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,<br>No father owning it—which is indeed<br>More criminal in thee than it—so thou<br>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage<br>Look for no less than death.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1342	1342	1	6	Break up the seals and read.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1350	1350	1	4	Hast thou read truth?
Leontes_WT	3	2	1352	1353	2	17	There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.<br>The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1355	1355	1	4	What is the business?
Leontes_WT	3	2	1359	1359	1	2	How? Gone?
Leontes_WT	3	2	1361	1363	3	16	Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves<br>Do strike at my injustice.<br>How now there?
Leontes_WT	3	2	1366	1390	25	173	Take her hence.<br>Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover.<br>I have too much believed mine own suspicion.<br>Beseech you, tenderly apply to her<br>Some remedies for life.<br>Apollo, pardon<br>My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle.<br>I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,<br>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,<br>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;<br>For, being transported by my jealousies<br>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose<br>Camillo for the minister to poison<br>My friend Polixenes, which had been done<br>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied<br>My swift command, though I with death and with<br>Reward did threaten and encourage him,<br>Not doing it and being done. He, most humane<br>And filled with honor, to my kingly guest<br>Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,<br>Which you knew great, and to the hazard<br>Of all incertainties himself commended,<br>No richer than his honor. How he glisters<br>Through my rust, and how his piety<br>Does my deeds make the blacker!
Leontes_WT	3	2	1437	1439	3	19	Go on, go on.<br>Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved<br>All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.
Leontes_WT	3	2	1459	1470	12	94	Thou didst speak but well<br>When most the truth, which I receive much better<br>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me<br>To the dead bodies of my queen and son.<br>One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall<br>The causes of their death appear, unto<br>Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit<br>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there<br>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature<br>Will bear up with this exercise, so long<br>I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me<br>To these sorrows.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2820	2826	7	48	Whilst I remember<br>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget<br>My blemishes in them, and so still think of<br>The wrong I did myself, which was so much<br>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and<br>Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man<br>Bred his hopes out of.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2832	2836	5	37	I think so. Killed?<br>She I killed? I did so, but thou strik’st me<br>Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter<br>Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,<br>Say so but seldom.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2871	2876	6	40	Good Paulina,<br>Who hast the memory of Hermione,<br>I know, in honor, O, that ever I<br>Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now<br>I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes,<br>Have taken treasure from her lips—
Leontes_WT	5	1	2879	2884	6	39	Thou speak’st truth.<br>No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,<br>And better used, would make her sainted spirit<br>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,<br>Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,<br>And begin <span class="quote" data-words="3">Why to me?</span>
Leontes_WT	5	1	2887	2888	2	11	She had, and would incense me<br>To murder her I married.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2895	2897	3	17	Stars, stars,<br>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;<br>I’ll have no wife, Paulina.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2900	2900	1	7	Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2915	2916	2	11	My true Paulina,<br>We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2924	2928	5	34	What with him? He comes not<br>Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,<br>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us<br>’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced<br>By need and accident. What train?
Leontes_WT	5	1	2931	2931	1	6	His princess, say you, with him?
Leontes_WT	5	1	2955	2959	5	26	Go, Cleomenes.<br>Yourself, assisted with your honored friends,<br>Bring them to our embracement.<br>Still, ’tis strange<br>He thus should steal upon us.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2964	2984	21	156	Prithee, no more; cease. Thou<br>know’st<br>He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,<br>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches<br>Will bring me to consider that which may<br>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.<br>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,<br>For she did print your royal father off,<br>Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,<br>Your father’s image is so hit in you,<br>His very air, that I should call you brother,<br>As I did him, and speak of something wildly<br>By us performed before. Most dearly welcome,<br>And your fair princess—goddess! O, alas,<br>I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and Earth<br>Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as<br>You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost—<br>All mine own folly—the society,<br>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,<br>Though bearing misery, I desire my life<br>Once more to look on him.
Leontes_WT	5	1	2996	3005	10	71	O my brother,<br>Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir<br>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,<br>So rarely kind, are as interpreters<br>Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,<br>As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too<br>Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage,<br>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,<br>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less<br>Th’ adventure of her person?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3008	3009	2	12	Where the warlike Smalus,<br>That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3021	3031	11	80	The blessèd gods<br>Purge all infection from our air whilst you<br>Do climate here! You have a holy father,<br>A graceful gentleman, against whose person,<br>So sacred as it is, I have done sin,<br>For which the heavens, taking angry note,<br>Have left me issueless. And your father’s blest,<br>As he from heaven merits it, with you,<br>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been<br>Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,<br>Such goodly things as you?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3040	3040	1	3	Where’s Bohemia? Speak.
Leontes_WT	5	1	3054	3054	1	2	Who? Camillo?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3064	3064	1	3	You are married?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3068	3069	2	9	My lord,<br>Is this the daughter of a king?
Leontes_WT	5	1	3072	3077	6	50	That <span class="quote" data-words="1">once,</span> I see, by your good father’s speed<br>Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,<br>Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,<br>Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry<br>Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,<br>That you might well enjoy her.
Leontes_WT	5	1	3086	3087	2	15	Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,<br>Which he counts but a trifle.
Leontes_WT	5	1	3093	3100	8	58	I thought of her<br>Even in these looks I made. But your<br>petition<br>Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.<br>Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires,<br>I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand<br>I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,<br>And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3288	3289	2	14	O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort<br>That I have had of thee!
Leontes_WT	5	3	3297	3303	7	47	O Paulina,<br>We honor you with trouble. But we came<br>To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery<br>Have we passed through, not without much content<br>In many singularities; but we saw not<br>That which my daughter came to look upon,<br>The statue of her mother.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3314	3320	7	48	Her natural posture!—<br>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed<br>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she<br>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender<br>As infancy and grace.—But yet, Paulina,<br>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing<br>So agèd as this seems.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3325	3335	11	85	As now she might have done,<br>So much to my good comfort as it is<br>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,<br>Even with such life of majesty—warm life,<br>As now it coldly stands—when first I wooed her.<br>I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me<br>For being more stone than it?—O royal piece,<br>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has<br>My evils conjured to remembrance and<br>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,<br>Standing like stone with thee.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3359	3359	1	5	Do not draw the curtain.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3362	3367	6	36	Let be, let be.<br>Would I were dead but that methinks already—<br>What was he that did make it?—See, my lord,<br>Would you not deem it breathed? And that those<br>veins<br>Did verily bear blood?
Leontes_WT	5	3	3370	3371	2	15	The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,<br>As we are mocked with art.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3375	3378	4	27	O sweet Paulina,<br>Make me to think so twenty years together!<br>No settled senses of the world can match<br>The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3381	3386	6	41	Do, Paulina,<br>For this affliction has a taste as sweet<br>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks<br>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel<br>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<br>For I will kiss her.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3391	3391	1	5	No, not these twenty years.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3401	3404	4	30	What you can make her do<br>I am content to look on; what to speak,<br>I am content to hear, for ’tis as easy<br>To make her speak as move.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3409	3410	2	5	Proceed.<br>No foot shall stir.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3423	3425	3	15	O, she’s warm!<br>If this be magic, let it be an art<br>Lawful as eating.
Leontes_WT	5	3	3457	3479	23	171	O peace, Paulina.<br>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<br>As I by thine a wife. This is a match,<br>And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found<br>mine—<br>But how is to be questioned, for I saw her,<br>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<br>A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—<br>For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee<br>An honorable husband.—Come, Camillo,<br>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<br>Is richly noted and here justified<br>By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.<br>What, look upon my brother! Both<br>your pardons<br>That e’er I put between your holy looks<br>My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law<br>And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,<br>Is troth-plight to your daughter.—Good Paulina,<br>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<br>Each one demand and answer to his part<br>Performed in this wide gap of time since first<br>We were dissevered. Hastily lead away.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	647	649	3	24	Behind the tuft of pines I met them. Never<br>Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them<br>Even to their ships.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	668	670	3	15	By his great authority,<br>Which often hath no less prevailed than so<br>On your command.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	755	755	1	7	Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	759	763	5	41	For her, my lord,<br>I dare my life lay down—and will do ’t, sir,<br>Please you t’ accept it—that the Queen is spotless<br>I’ th’ eyes of heaven, and to you—I mean<br>In this which you accuse her.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	772	772	1	3	Good my lord—
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	795	798	4	34	I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,<br>Upon this ground. And more it would content me<br>To have her honor true than your suspicion,<br>Be blamed for ’t how you might.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	1	829	830	2	4	Well done,<br>my lord.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	3	1106	1112	7	58	Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.<br>We have always truly served you, and beseech<br>So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,<br>As recompense of our dear services<br>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,<br>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must<br>Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	3	1163	1164	2	10	So please you, sir, their speed<br>Hath been beyond account.
LORDS.0.1_WT	2	3	952	952	1	4	You must not enter.
LORDS.0.1_WT	3	2	1325	1327	3	15	This your request<br>Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,<br>And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.
LORDS.0.1_WT	3	2	1394	1394	1	6	What fit is this, good lady?
LORDS.0.1_WT	3	2	1424	1424	1	4	The higher powers forbid!
LORDS.0.1_WT	3	2	1440	1442	3	17	Say no more.<br>Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault<br>I’ th’ boldness of your speech.
LORDS.1_WT	5	1	3032	3039	8	56	Most noble sir,<br>That which I shall report will bear no credit,<br>Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,<br>Bohemia greets you from himself by me,<br>Desires you to attach his son, who has—<br>His dignity and duty both cast off—<br>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with<br>A shepherd’s daughter.
LORDS.1_WT	5	1	3041	3048	8	59	Here in your city. I now came from him.<br>I speak amazedly, and it becomes<br>My marvel and my message. To your court<br>Whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems,<br>Of this fair couple—meets he on the way<br>The father of this seeming lady and<br>Her brother, having both their country quitted<br>With this young prince.
LORDS.1_WT	5	1	3052	3053	2	12	Lay ’t so to his charge.<br>He’s with the King your father.
LORDS.1_WT	5	1	3055	3060	6	45	Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now<br>Has these poor men in question. Never saw I<br>Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,<br>Forswear themselves as often as they speak.<br>Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them<br>With divers deaths in death.
LORDS_WT	2	3	1103	1104	2	13	We can, my royal liege.<br>He is not guilty of her coming hither.
LORDS_WT	3	2	1348	1348	1	6	Now blessèd be the great Apollo!
Mamillius_WT	1	2	200	200	1	4	Ay, my good lord.
Mamillius_WT	1	2	210	210	1	6	Yes, if you will, my lord.
Mamillius_WT	1	2	251	251	1	5	No, my lord, I’ll fight.
Mamillius_WT	1	2	305	305	1	6	I am like you, they say.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	608	608	1	5	No, I’ll none of you.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	610	611	2	19	You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if<br>I were a baby still.—I love you better.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	613	617	5	36	Not for because<br>Your brows are blacker—yet black brows, they say,<br>Become some women best, so that there be not<br>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,<br>Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	619	620	2	14	I learned it out of women’s faces.—Pray now,<br>What color are your eyebrows?
Mamillius_WT	2	1	622	623	2	18	Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose<br>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	634	634	1	6	Merry or sad shall ’t be?
Mamillius_WT	2	1	636	637	2	13	A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one<br>Of sprites and goblins.
Mamillius_WT	2	1	641	641	1	4	There was a man—
Mamillius_WT	2	1	643	644	2	15	Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,<br>Yond crickets shall not hear it.
Mariner_WT	3	3	1473	1477	5	36	Ay, my lord, and fear<br>We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly<br>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,<br>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry<br>And frown upon ’s.
Mariner_WT	3	3	1481	1484	4	32	Make your best haste, and go not<br>Too far i’ th’ land. ’Tis like to be loud weather.<br>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures<br>Of prey that keep upon ’t.
Mariner_WT	3	3	1487	1488	2	12	I am glad at heart<br>To be so rid o’ th’ business.
Mopsa_WT			2177	2176	1	2	<span class="song" data-words="2">O, whither?</span>
Mopsa_WT			2179	2178	2	12	<span class="song" data-words="12">It becomes thy oath full well<br>Thou to me thy secrets tell.</span>
Mopsa_WT			2182	2181	1	8	<span class="song" data-words="8">Or thou goest to th’ grange or mill.</span>
Mopsa_WT			2188	2187	2	12	<span class="song" data-words="12">Thou hast sworn it more to me.<br>Then whither goest? Say whither.</span>
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2033	2033	1	4	Now, in good time!
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2109	2110	2	14	I was promised them against the feast, but they<br>come not too late now.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2113	2115	3	22	He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe<br>he has paid you more, which will shame you to give<br>him again.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2123	2124	2	16	I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry<br>lace and a pair of sweet gloves.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2134	2135	2	19	Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print<br>alife, for then we are sure they are true.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2140	2140	1	5	Is it true, think you?
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2146	2146	1	5	Pray you now, buy it.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2164	2164	1	5	Let’s have some merry ones.
Mopsa_WT	4	4	2169	2170	2	18	We can both sing it. If thou ’lt bear a part, thou<br>shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.
Paulina_WT	2	2	843	849	7	48	The keeper of the prison, call to him.<br>Let him have knowledge who I am.<br>Good lady,<br>No court in Europe is too good for thee.<br>What dost thou then in prison?<br>Now, good sir,<br>You know me, do you not?
Paulina_WT	2	2	852	853	2	8	Pray you then,<br>Conduct me to the Queen.
Paulina_WT	2	2	856	858	3	27	Here’s ado, to lock up honesty and honor from<br>Th’ access of gentle visitors. Is ’t lawful, pray you,<br>To see her women? Any of them? Emilia?
Paulina_WT	2	2	862	863	2	7	I pray now, call her.—<br>Withdraw yourselves.
Paulina_WT	2	2	865	869	5	30	Well, be ’t so, prithee.<br>Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain<br>As passes coloring.<br>Dear gentlewoman,<br>How fares our gracious lady?
Paulina_WT	2	2	874	874	1	2	A boy?
Paulina_WT	2	2	879	893	15	108	I dare be sworn.<br>These dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ King, beshrew<br>them!<br>He must be told on ’t, and he shall. The office<br>Becomes a woman best. I’ll take ’t upon me.<br>If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister<br>And never to my red-looked anger be<br>The trumpet anymore. Pray you, Emilia,<br>Commend my best obedience to the Queen.<br>If she dares trust me with her little babe,<br>I’ll show ’t the King and undertake to be<br>Her advocate to th’ loud’st We do not know<br>How he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child.<br>The silence often of pure innocence<br>Persuades when speaking fails.
Paulina_WT	2	2	904	907	4	28	Tell her, Emilia,<br>I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from ’t<br>As boldness from my bosom, let ’t not be doubted<br>I shall do good.
Paulina_WT	2	2	914	919	6	46	You need not fear it, sir.<br>This child was prisoner to the womb, and is<br>By law and process of great nature thence<br>Freed and enfranchised, not a party to<br>The anger of the King, nor guilty of,<br>If any be, the trespass of the Queen.
Paulina_WT	2	2	921	922	2	14	Do not you fear. Upon mine honor, I<br>Will stand betwixt you and danger.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1008	1012	5	35	Not so.<br>I am as ignorant in that as you<br>In so entitling me, and no less honest<br>Than you are mad—which is enough, I’ll warrant,<br>As this world goes, to pass for honest.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1019	1022	4	21	Forever<br>Unvenerable be thy hands if thou<br>Tak’st up the Princess by that forced baseness<br>Which he has put upon ’t.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1024	1025	2	15	So I would you did. Then ’twere past all doubt<br>You’d call your children yours.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1028	1037	10	71	Nor I, nor any<br>But one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he<br>The sacred honor of himself, his queen’s,<br>His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,<br>Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will<br>not—<br>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse<br>He cannot be compelled to ’t—once remove<br>The root of his opinion, which is rotten<br>As ever oak or stone was sound.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1045	1058	14	110	It is yours,<br>And, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,<br>So like you ’tis the worse.—Behold, my lords,<br>Although the print be little, the whole matter<br>And copy of the father—eye, nose, lip,<br>The trick of ’s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,<br>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his<br>smiles,<br>The very mold and frame of hand, nail, finger.<br>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it<br>So like to him that got it, if thou hast<br>The ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colors<br>No yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does,<br>Her children not her husband’s.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1066	1067	2	10	A most unworthy and unnatural lord<br>Can do no more.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1069	1077	9	55	I care not.<br>It is an heretic that makes the fire,<br>Not she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;<br>But this most cruel usage of your queen,<br>Not able to produce more accusation<br>Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something<br>savors<br>Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,<br>Yea, scandalous to the world.
Paulina_WT	2	3	1082	1087	6	53	I pray you do not push me; I’ll be gone.—<br>Look to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours. Jove send her<br>A better guiding spirit.—What needs these hands?<br>You that are thus so tender o’er his follies<br>Will never do him good, not one of you.<br>So, so. Farewell, we are gone.
Paulina_WT	2	3	953	956	4	30	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.<br>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,<br>Than the Queen’s life? A gracious innocent soul,<br>More free than he is jealous.
Paulina_WT	2	3	960	967	8	61	Not so hot, good sir.<br>I come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you<br>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh<br>At each his needless heavings, such as you<br>Nourish the cause of his awaking. I<br>Do come with words as medicinal as true,<br>Honest as either, to purge him of that humor<br>That presses him from sleep.
Paulina_WT	2	3	969	970	2	13	No noise, my lord, but needful conference<br>About some gossips for your Highness.
Paulina_WT	2	3	979	982	4	28	From all dishonesty he can. In this,<br>Unless he take the course that you have done—<br>Commit me for committing honor—trust it,<br>He shall not rule me.
Paulina_WT	2	3	986	992	7	47	Good my liege, I come—<br>And I beseech you hear me, who professes<br>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,<br>Your most obedient counselor, yet that dares<br>Less appear so in comforting your evils<br>Than such as most seem yours—I say I come<br>From your good queen.
Paulina_WT	2	3	994	996	4	26	Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say <span class="quote" data-words="2">goodqueen,</span><br>And would by combat make her good, so were I<br>A man, the worst about you.
Paulina_WT	2	3	999	1004	6	44	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes<br>First hand me. On mine own accord I’ll off,<br>But first I’ll do my errand.—The good queen,<br>For she is good, hath brought you forth a<br>daughter—<br>Here ’tis—commends it to your blessing.
Paulina_WT	3	2	1364	1365	2	15	This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down<br>And see what death is doing.
Paulina_WT	3	2	1391	1393	3	14	Woe the while!<br>O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,<br>Break too!
Paulina_WT	3	2	1395	1423	29	223	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?<br>What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling<br>In leads or oils? What old or newer torture<br>Must I receive, whose every word deserves<br>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,<br>Together working with thy jealousies,<br>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<br>For girls of nine, O, think what they have done,<br>And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all<br>Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.<br>That thou betrayedst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;<br>That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant<br>And damnable ingrateful. Nor was ’t much<br>Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo’s honor,<br>To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,<br>More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon<br>The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter<br>To be or none or little, though a devil<br>Would have shed water out of fire ere done ’t.<br>Nor is ’t directly laid to thee the death<br>Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,<br>Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart<br>That could conceive a gross and foolish sire<br>Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no,<br>Laid to thy answer. But the last—O lords,<br>When I have said, cry woe!—the Queen, the Queen,<br>The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance<br>for ’t<br>Not dropped down yet.
Paulina_WT	3	2	1425	1436	12	98	I say she’s dead. I’ll swear ’t. If word nor oath<br>Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring<br>Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,<br>Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you<br>As I would do the gods.—But, O thou tyrant,<br>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier<br>Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee<br>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees<br>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,<br>Upon a barren mountain, and still winter<br>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods<br>To look that way thou wert.
Paulina_WT	3	2	1443	1458	16	122	I am sorry for ’t.<br>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,<br>I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much<br>The rashness of a woman. He is touched<br>To th’ noble heart.—What’s gone and what’s past<br>help<br>Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction<br>At my petition. I beseech you, rather<br>Let me be punished, that have minded you<br>Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,<br>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.<br>The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!—<br>I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.<br>I’ll not remember you of my own lord,<br>Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,<br>And I’ll say nothing.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2827	2831	5	34	True, too true, my lord.<br>If one by one you wedded all the world,<br>Or from the all that are took something good<br>To make a perfect woman, she you killed<br>Would be unparalleled.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2842	2843	2	10	You are one of those<br>Would have him wed again.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2855	2870	16	120	There is none worthy,<br>Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods<br>Will have fulfilled their secret purposes.<br>For has not the divine Apollo said,<br>Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle,<br>That King Leontes shall not have an heir<br>Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall<br>Is all as monstrous to our human reason<br>As my Antigonus to break his grave<br>And come again to me—who, on my life,<br>Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel<br>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,<br>Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue.<br>The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander<br>Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor<br>Was like to be the best.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2877	2878	2	9	And left them<br>More rich for what they yielded.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2885	2886	2	8	Had she such power,<br>She had just cause.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2889	2894	6	48	I should so.<br>Were I the ghost that walked, I’d bid you mark<br>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t<br>You chose her. Then I’d shriek, that even your ears<br>Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed<br>Should be <span class="quote" data-words="2">Remember mine.</span>
Paulina_WT	5	1	2898	2899	2	11	Will you swear<br>Never to marry but by my free leave?
Paulina_WT	5	1	2901	2901	1	9	Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2903	2905	3	12	Unless another<br>As like Hermione as is her picture<br>Affront his eye.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2907	2914	8	58	I have done.<br>Yet if my lord will marry—if you will, sir,<br>No remedy but you will—give me the office<br>To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young<br>As was your former, but she shall be such<br>As, walked your first queen’s ghost, it should take<br>joy<br>To see her in your arms.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2917	2919	3	13	That<br>Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath,<br>Never till then.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2934	2943	10	70	O Hermione,<br>As every present time doth boast itself<br>Above a better gone, so must thy grave<br>Give way to what’s seen now. Sir, you<br>yourself<br>Have said and writ so—but your writing now<br>Is colder than that theme—she had not been<br>Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse<br>Flowed with her beauty once. ’Tis shrewdly ebbed<br>To say you have seen a better.
Paulina_WT	5	1	2951	2951	1	3	How, not women?
Paulina_WT	5	1	2960	2963	4	25	Had our prince,<br>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired<br>Well with this lord. There was not full a month<br>Between their births.
Paulina_WT	5	1	3088	3092	5	30	Sir, my liege,<br>Your eye hath too much youth in ’t. Not a month<br>’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such<br>gazes<br>Than what you look on now.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3290	3296	7	54	What, sovereign sir,<br>I did not well, I meant well. All my services<br>You have paid home. But that you have vouchsafed,<br>With your crowned brother and these your contracted<br>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,<br>It is a surplus of your grace which never<br>My life may last to answer.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3304	3313	10	86	As she lived peerless,<br>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,<br>Excels whatever yet you looked upon<br>Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it<br>Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare<br>To see the life as lively mocked as ever<br>Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say ’tis well.<br>I like your silence. It the more shows off<br>Your wonder. But yet speak. First you, my liege.<br>Comes it not something near?
Paulina_WT	5	3	3322	3324	3	21	So much the more our carver’s excellence,<br>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her<br>As she lived now.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3342	3344	3	12	O, patience!<br>The statue is but newly fixed; the color’s<br>Not dry.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3354	3358	5	28	Indeed, my lord,<br>If I had thought the sight of my poor image<br>Would thus have wrought you—for the stone is<br>mine—<br>I’d not have showed it.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3360	3361	2	15	No longer shall you gaze on ’t, lest your fancy<br>May think anon it moves.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3372	3374	3	16	I’ll draw the curtain.<br>My lord’s almost so far transported that<br>He’ll think anon it lives.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3379	3380	2	16	I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you, but<br>I could afflict you farther.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3387	3390	4	29	Good my lord, forbear.<br>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet.<br>You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own<br>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
Paulina_WT	5	3	3394	3400	7	44	Either forbear,<br>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you<br>For more amazement. If you can behold it,<br>I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend<br>And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think—<br>Which I protest against—I am assisted<br>By wicked powers.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3405	3408	4	26	It is required<br>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still—<br>Or those that think it is unlawful business<br>I am about, let them depart.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3411	3422	12	98	Music, awake her! Strike!<br>’Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more. Approach.<br>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,<br>I’ll fill your grave up. Stir, nay, come away.<br>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<br>Dear life redeems you.—You perceive she stirs.<br>Start not. Her actions shall be holy as<br>You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her<br>Until you see her die again, for then<br>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.<br>When she was young, you wooed her; now in age<br>Is she become the suitor?
Paulina_WT	5	3	3431	3439	9	54	That she is living,<br>Were it but told you, should be hooted at<br>Like an old tale, but it appears she lives,<br>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.<br>Please you to interpose, fair madam.<br>Kneel<br>And pray your mother’s blessing.<br>Turn, good lady.<br>Our Perdita is found.
Paulina_WT	5	3	3449	3456	8	55	There’s time enough for that,<br>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble<br>Your joys with like relation. Go together,<br>You precious winners all. Your exultation<br>Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle,<br>Will wing me to some withered bough and there<br>My mate, that’s never to be found again,<br>Lament till I am lost.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1844	1853	10	77	Sir, my gracious lord,<br>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me;<br>O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,<br>The gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscured<br>With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,<br>Most goddesslike pranked up. But that our feasts<br>In every mess have folly, and the feeders<br>Digest it with a custom, I should blush<br>To see you so attired, swoon, I think,<br>To show myself a glass.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1857	1865	9	72	Now Jove afford you cause.<br>To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness<br>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble<br>To think your father by some accident<br>Should pass this way as you did. O the Fates,<br>How would he look to see his work, so noble,<br>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how<br>Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts, behold<br>The sternness of his presence?
Perdita_WT	4	4	1878	1884	7	41	O, but sir,<br>Your resolution cannot hold when ’tis<br>Opposed, as it must be, by th’ power of the King.<br>One of these two must be necessities,<br>Which then will speak: that you must change this<br>purpose<br>Or I my life.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1897	1898	2	6	O Lady Fortune,<br>Stand you auspicious!
Perdita_WT	4	4	1918	1927	10	57	Sir, welcome.<br>It is my father’s will I should take on me<br>The hostess-ship o’ th’ day. You’re<br>welcome, sir.—<br>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.—Reverend<br>sirs,<br>For you there’s rosemary and rue. These keep<br>Seeming and savor all the winter long.<br>Grace and remembrance be to you both,<br>And welcome to our shearing.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1931	1937	7	50	Sir, the year growing ancient,<br>Not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth<br>Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season<br>Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors,<br>Which some call nature’s bastards. Of that kind<br>Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not<br>To get slips of them.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1940	1942	3	19	For I have heard it said<br>There is an art which in their piedness shares<br>With great creating nature.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1953	1953	1	3	So it is.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1956	1966	11	79	I’ll not put<br>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,<br>No more than, were I painted, I would wish<br>This youth should say ’twere well, and only<br>therefore<br>Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:<br>Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,<br>The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ th’ sun<br>And with him rises weeping. These are flowers<br>Of middle summer, and I think they are given<br>To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1969	1990	22	150	Out, alas!<br>You’d be so lean that blasts of January<br>Would blow you through and through.<br>Now, my fair’st friend,<br>I would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might<br>Become your time of day<br>and yours, and yours,<br>That wear upon your virgin branches yet<br>Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,<br>For the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall<br>From Dis’s wagon! Daffodils,<br>That come before the swallow dares, and take<br>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,<br>But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes<br>Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,<br>That die unmarried ere they can behold<br>Bright Phoebus in his strength—a malady<br>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and<br>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,<br>The flower-de-luce being one—O, these I lack<br>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,<br>To strew him o’er and o’er.
Perdita_WT	4	4	1992	1998	7	52	No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,<br>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,<br>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your<br>flowers.<br>Methinks I play as I have seen them do<br>In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine<br>Does change my disposition.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2011	2016	6	41	O Doricles,<br>Your praises are too large. But that your youth<br>And the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t<br>Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,<br>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,<br>You wooed me the false way.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2022	2022	1	4	I’ll swear for ’em.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2087	2088	2	11	Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words<br>in ’s tunes.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2091	2091	1	8	Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2276	2279	4	26	I cannot speak<br>So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better.<br>By th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out<br>The purity of his.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2357	2367	11	84	Even here undone.<br>I was not much afeard, for once or twice<br>I was about to speak and tell him plainly<br>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court<br>Hides not his visage from our cottage but<br>Looks on alike. Will ’t please you, sir,<br>be gone?<br>I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,<br>Of your own state take care. This dream of mine—<br>Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,<br>But milk my ewes and weep.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2400	2402	3	20	How often have I told you ’twould be thus?<br>How often said my dignity would last<br>But till ’twere known?
Perdita_WT	4	4	2522	2524	3	18	One of these is true.<br>I think affliction may subdue the cheek<br>But not take in the mind.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2535	2536	2	9	Your pardon, sir. For this<br>I’ll blush you thanks.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2577	2578	2	9	Happy be you!<br>All that you speak shows fair.
Perdita_WT	4	4	2611	2612	2	12	I see the play so lies<br>That I must bear a part.
Perdita_WT	5	1	3061	3063	3	16	O my poor father!<br>The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have<br>Our contract celebrated.
Perdita_WT	5	3	3336	3341	6	37	And give me leave,<br>And do not say ’tis superstition, that<br>I kneel, and then implore her blessing.<br>Lady,<br>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,<br>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
Perdita_WT	5	3	3392	3393	2	8	So long could I<br>Stand by, a looker-on.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	104	104	1	2	No, madam.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	106	106	1	4	I may not, verily.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	119	122	4	23	Your guest, then, madam.<br>To be your prisoner should import offending,<br>Which is for me less easy to commit<br>Than you to punish.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	127	130	4	25	We were, fair queen,<br>Two lads that thought there was no more behind<br>But such a day tomorrow as today,<br>And to be boy eternal.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	133	142	10	66	We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun<br>And bleat the one at th’ other. What we changed<br>Was innocence for innocence. We knew not<br>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed<br>That any did. Had we pursued that life,<br>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared<br>With stronger blood, we should have answered<br>heaven<br>Boldly <span class="quote" data-words="2">Not guilty,</span> the imposition cleared<br>Hereditary ours.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	145	149	5	36	O my most sacred lady,<br>Temptations have since then been born to ’s, for<br>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;<br>Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes<br>Of my young playfellow.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	232	232	1	3	What means Sicilia?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	234	234	1	3	How, my lord?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	255	261	7	48	If at home, sir,<br>He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,<br>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,<br>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.<br>He makes a July’s day short as December,<br>And with his varying childness cures in me<br>Thoughts that would thick my blood.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	485	487	3	15	This is strange. Methinks<br>My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?—<br>Good day, Camillo.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	489	489	1	7	What is the news i’ th’ court?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	49	57	9	67	Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been<br>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne<br>Without a burden. Time as long again<br>Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,<br>And yet we should for perpetuity<br>Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,<br>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply<br>With one <span class="quote" data-words="3">We thank you</span> many thousands more<br>That go before it.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	491	498	8	62	The King hath on him such a countenance<br>As he had lost some province and a region<br>Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him<br>With customary compliment, when he,<br>Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling<br>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and<br>So leaves me to consider what is breeding<br>That changes thus his manners.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	501	508	8	63	How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not?<br>Be intelligent to me—’tis thereabouts;<br>For to yourself what you do know, you must,<br>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,<br>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror<br>Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be<br>A party in this alteration, finding<br>Myself thus altered with ’t.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	513	525	13	77	How caught of me?<br>Make me not sighted like the basilisk.<br>I have looked on thousands who have sped the<br>better<br>By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,<br>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto<br>Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns<br>Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,<br>In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,<br>If you know aught which does behoove my<br>knowledge<br>Thereof to be informed, imprison ’t not<br>In ignorant concealment.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	527	535	9	73	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?<br>I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?<br>I conjure thee by all the parts of man<br>Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least<br>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare<br>What incidency thou dost guess of harm<br>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;<br>Which way to be prevented, if to be;<br>If not, how best to bear it.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	542	542	1	3	On, good Camillo.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	544	544	1	3	By whom, Camillo?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	546	546	1	2	For what?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	551	558	8	58	O, then my best blood turn<br>To an infected jelly, and my name<br>Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!<br>Turn then my freshest reputation to<br>A savor that may strike the dullest nostril<br>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,<br>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection<br>That e’er was heard or read.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	567	567	1	4	How should this grow?
Polixenes_WT	1	2	584	600	17	132	I do believe thee.<br>I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand.<br>Be pilot to me and thy places shall<br>Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and<br>My people did expect my hence departure<br>Two days ago. This jealousy<br>Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare,<br>Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,<br>Must it be violent; and as he does conceive<br>He is dishonored by a man which ever<br>Professed to him, why, his revenges must<br>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.<br>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort<br>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing<br>Of his ill-ta’en suspicion. Come, Camillo,<br>I will respect thee as a father if<br>Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	60	65	6	44	Sir, that’s tomorrow.<br>I am questioned by my fears of what may chance<br>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow<br>No sneaping winds at home to make us say<br><span class="quote" data-words="6">This is put forth too truly.</span> Besides, I have stayed<br>To tire your Royalty.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	68	68	1	3	No longer stay.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	70	70	1	3	Very sooth, tomorrow.
Polixenes_WT	1	2	73	82	10	72	Press me not, beseech you, so.<br>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’<br>world,<br>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,<br>Were there necessity in your request, although<br>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs<br>Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder<br>Were in your love a whip to me, my stay<br>To you a charge and trouble. To save both,<br>Farewell, our brother.
Polixenes_WT	4	2	1649	1651	3	20	I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more<br>importunate. ’Tis a sickness denying thee anything,<br>a death to grant this.
Polixenes_WT	4	2	1658	1677	20	176	As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the<br>rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I<br>have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better<br>not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou,<br>having made me businesses which none without<br>thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to<br>execute them thyself or take away with thee the very<br>services thou hast done, which if I have not enough<br>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more<br>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit<br>therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country<br>Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very<br>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that<br>penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king<br>my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen<br>and children are even now to be afresh lamented.<br>Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my<br>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not<br>being gracious, than they are in losing them when<br>they have approved their virtues.
Polixenes_WT	4	2	1683	1690	8	63	I have considered so much, Camillo, and<br>with some care, so far that I have eyes under my<br>service which look upon his removedness, from<br>whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom<br>from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man,<br>they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the<br>imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an<br>unspeakable estate.
Polixenes_WT	4	2	1695	1702	8	69	That’s likewise part of my intelligence, but,<br>I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou<br>shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not<br>appearing what we are, have some question with<br>the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not<br>uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither.<br>Prithee be my present partner in this business, and<br>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
Polixenes_WT	4	2	1704	1705	2	7	My best Camillo. We must disguise<br>ourselves.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	1928	1930	3	15	Shepherdess—<br>A fair one are you—well you fit our ages<br>With flowers of winter.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	1938	1939	2	7	Wherefore, gentle maiden,<br>Do you neglect them?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	1943	1952	10	75	Say there be;<br>Yet nature is made better by no mean<br>But nature makes that mean. So, over that art<br>Which you say adds to nature is an art<br>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry<br>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,<br>And make conceive a bark of baser kind<br>By bud of nobler race. This is an art<br>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but<br>The art itself is nature.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	1954	1955	2	13	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,<br>And do not call them bastards.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2023	2026	4	29	This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever<br>Ran on the greensward. Nothing she does or seems<br>But smacks of something greater than herself,<br>Too noble for this place.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2036	2037	2	13	Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this<br>Which dances with your daughter?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2047	2047	1	3	She dances featly.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2073	2073	1	5	This is a brave fellow.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2218	2219	2	14	You weary those that refresh us. Pray, let’s<br>see these four threes of herdsmen.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2227	2242	16	123	O father, you’ll know more of that hereafter.<br>Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to<br>part them.<br>He’s simple, and tells much. How now,<br>fair shepherd?<br>Your heart is full of something that does take<br>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young<br>And handed love, as you do, I was wont<br>To load my she with knacks. I would have ransacked<br>The peddler’s silken treasury and have poured it<br>To her acceptance. You have let him go<br>And nothing marted with him. If your lass<br>Interpretation should abuse and call this<br>Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited<br>For a reply, at least if you make a care<br>Of happy holding her.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2255	2259	5	31	What follows this?—<br>How prettily th’ young swain seems to wash<br>The hand was fair before.—I have put you out.<br>But to your protestation. Let me hear<br>What you profess.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2261	2261	1	5	And this my neighbor too?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2272	2272	1	2	Fairly offered.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2291	2293	3	9	Soft, swain, awhile, beseech<br>you.<br>Have you a father?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2295	2295	1	4	Knows he of this?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2297	2305	9	65	Methinks a father<br>Is at the nuptial of his son a guest<br>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,<br>Is not your father grown incapable<br>Of reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid<br>With age and alt’ring rheums? Can he speak? Hear?<br>Know man from man? Dispute his own estate?<br>Lies he not bedrid, and again does nothing<br>But what he did being childish?
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2309	2315	7	46	By my white beard,<br>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong<br>Something unfilial. Reason my son<br>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason<br>The father, all whose joy is nothing else<br>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel<br>In such a business.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2320	2320	1	4	Let him know ’t.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2322	2322	1	3	Prithee let him.
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2328	2337	10	63	Mark your divorce,<br>young sir,<br>Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base<br>To be acknowledged. Thou a scepter’s heir<br>That thus affects a sheep-hook!—Thou, old traitor,<br>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can<br>But shorten thy life one week.—And thou, fresh<br>piece<br>Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know<br>The royal fool thou cop’st with—
Polixenes_WT	4	4	2339	2356	18	145	I’ll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made<br>More homely than thy state.—For thee, fond boy,<br>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh<br>That thou no more shalt see this knack—as never<br>I mean thou shalt—we’ll bar thee from succession,<br>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,<br>Far’r than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.<br>Follow us to the court. Thou, churl,<br>for this time,<br>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee<br>From the dead blow of it.—And you, enchantment,<br>Worthy enough a herdsman—yea, him too,<br>That makes himself, but for our honor therein,<br>Unworthy thee—if ever henceforth thou<br>These rural latches to his entrance open,<br>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,<br>I will devise a death as cruel for thee<br>As thou art tender to ’t.
Polixenes_WT	5	3	3321	3321	1	4	O, not by much!
Polixenes_WT	5	3	3350	3353	4	28	Dear my brother,<br>Let him that was the cause of this have power<br>To take off so much grief from you as he<br>Will piece up in himself.
Polixenes_WT	5	3	3368	3369	2	10	Masterly done.<br>The very life seems warm upon her lip.
Polixenes_WT	5	3	3426	3426	1	3	She embraces him.
Polixenes_WT	5	3	3429	3430	2	15	Ay, and make it manifest where she has lived,<br>Or how stol’n from the dead.
SERVANTS.0_WT	2	3	958	959	2	12	Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded<br>None should come at him.
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2052	2057	6	54	O, master, if you did but hear the peddler at<br>the door, you would never dance again after a tabor<br>and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He<br>sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He<br>utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s<br>ears grew to his tunes.
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2062	2070	11	91	He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes.<br>No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He<br>has the prettiest love songs for maids, so without<br>bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate burdens<br>of dildos and fadings, <span class="quote" data-words="5">Jump her and thumpher.</span> And where some stretch-mouthed rascal<br>would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul<br>gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer<br><span class="quote" data-words="7">Whoop, do me no harm, good man</span>; puts him off,<br>slights him, with <span class="quote" data-words="7">Whoop, do me no harm, goodman.</span>
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2077	2084	8	66	He hath ribbons of all the colors i’ th’ rainbow;<br>points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia<br>can learnedly handle, though they come to him by<br>th’ gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns—why,<br>he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses.<br>You would think a smock were a she-angel, he so<br>chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the<br>square on ’t.
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2206	2214	9	67	Master, there is three carters,<br>three shepherds, three neatherds, three swineherds,<br>that have made themselves all men of hair.<br>They call themselves saultiers, and they have a<br>dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of<br>gambols, because they are not in ’t, but they themselves<br>are o’ th’ mind, if it be not too rough for<br>some that know little but bowling, it will please<br>plentifully.
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2220	2223	4	31	One three of them, by their own report, sir,<br>hath danced before the King, and not the worst of<br>the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’<br>square.
SERVANTS.SHEPHERD.1_WT	4	4	2226	2226	1	6	Why, they stay at door, sir.
SERVANTS.X.1_WT	2	3	932	932	1	2	My lord.
SERVANTS.X.1_WT	2	3	934	935	2	11	He took good rest tonight. ’Tis hoped<br>His sickness is discharged.
SERVANTS.X.1_WT	3	2	1354	1354	1	6	My lord the King, the King!
SERVANTS.X.1_WT	3	2	1356	1358	3	24	O sir, I shall be hated to report it.<br>The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear<br>Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.
SERVANTS.X.1_WT	3	2	1360	1360	1	2	Is dead.
SERVANTS.X.2_WT	2	3	1158	1162	5	31	Please your Highness, posts<br>From those you sent to th’ oracle are come<br>An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,<br>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,<br>Hasting to th’ court.
SERVANTS.X.3_WT	5	1	2920	2923	4	26	One that gives out himself Prince Florizell,<br>Son of Polixenes, with his princess—she<br>The fairest I have yet beheld—desires access<br>To your high presence.
SERVANTS.X.3_WT	5	1	2929	2930	2	6	But few,<br>And those but mean.
SERVANTS.X.3_WT	5	1	2932	2933	2	16	Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,<br>That e’er the sun shone bright on.
SERVANTS.X.3_WT	5	1	2944	2950	7	48	Pardon, madam.<br>The one I have almost forgot—your pardon;<br>The other, when she has obtained your eye,<br>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,<br>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal<br>Of all professors else, make proselytes<br>Of who she but bid follow.
SERVANTS.X.3_WT	5	1	2952	2954	3	23	Women will love her that she is a woman<br>More worth than any man; men, that she is<br>The rarest of all women.
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1535	1553	19	174	I would there were no age between ten and<br>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the<br>rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting<br>wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,<br>fighting—Hark you now. Would any but these<br>boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt<br>this weather? They have scared away two of my best<br>sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than<br>the master. If anywhere I have them, ’tis by the<br>seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an ’t be thy will,<br>what have we here? Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very<br>pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty<br>one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I<br>am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman<br>in the scape. This has been some stair-work,<br>some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They<br>were warmer that got this than the poor thing is<br>here. I’ll take it up for pity. Yet I’ll tarry till my son<br>come. He halloed but even now.—Whoa-ho-ho!
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1555	1557	3	25	What, art so near? If thou ’lt see a thing to<br>talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.<br>What ail’st thou, man?
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1562	1562	1	5	Why, boy, how is it?
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1578	1578	1	7	Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1583	1584	2	11	Would I had been by to have helped the old<br>man.
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1588	1595	8	68	Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look<br>thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met’st with<br>things dying, I with things newborn. Here’s a sight<br>for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire’s<br>child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open<br>’t. So, let’s see. It was told me I should be rich by<br>the fairies. This is some changeling. Open ’t. What’s<br>within, boy?
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1599	1603	5	44	This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so.<br>Up with ’t, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.<br>We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires<br>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good<br>boy, the next way home.
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1609	1611	3	25	That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern<br>by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to<br>th’ sight of him.
Shepherd_WT	3	3	1614	1615	2	12	’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good<br>deeds on ’t.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	1902	1917	16	136	Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon<br>This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,<br>Both dame and servant; welcomed all; served all;<br>Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here<br>At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;<br>On his shoulder, and his; her face afire<br>With labor, and the thing she took to quench it<br>She would to each one sip. You are retired<br>As if you were a feasted one and not<br>The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid<br>These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is<br>A way to make us better friends, more known.<br>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself<br>That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,<br>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,<br>As your good flock shall prosper.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2038	2046	9	74	They call him Doricles, and boasts himself<br>To have a worthy feeding. But I have it<br>Upon his own report, and I believe it.<br>He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.<br>I think so too, for never gazed the moon<br>Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,<br>As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,<br>I think there is not half a kiss to choose<br>Who loves another best.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2048	2051	4	29	So she does anything, though I report it<br>That should be silent. If young Doricles<br>Do light upon her, she shall bring him that<br>Which he not dreams of.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2215	2217	3	19	Away! We’ll none on ’t. Here has been too<br>much homely foolery already.—I know, sir, we<br>weary you.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2224	2225	2	16	Leave your prating. Since these good men<br>are pleased, let them come in—but quickly now.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2274	2275	2	9	But my daughter,<br>Say you the like to him?
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2280	2283	4	26	Take hands, a bargain.—<br>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t:<br>I give my daughter to him and will make<br>Her portion equal his.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2289	2290	2	6	Come, your hand—<br>And daughter, yours.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2324	2325	2	15	Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve<br>At knowing of thy choice.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2338	2338	1	3	O, my heart!
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2370	2384	15	103	I cannot speak, nor think,<br>Nor dare to know that which I know.<br>O sir,<br>You have undone a man of fourscore three,<br>That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,<br>To die upon the bed my father died,<br>To lie close by his honest bones; but now<br>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me<br>Where no priest shovels in dust. O<br>cursèd wretch,<br>That knew’st this was the Prince, and wouldst<br>adventure<br>To mingle faith with him!—Undone, undone!<br>If I might die within this hour, I have lived<br>To die when I desire.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2652	2652	1	4	Nay, but hear me.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2654	2654	1	3	Go to, then.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2662	2665	4	38	I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and<br>his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest<br>man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to<br>make me the King’s brother-in-law.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2671	2672	2	18	Well, let us to the King. There is that in this<br>fardel will make him scratch his beard.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2680	2680	1	8	To th’ palace, an it like your Worship.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2694	2694	1	9	Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2705	2705	1	7	My business, sir, is to the King.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2707	2707	1	7	I know not, an ’t like you.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2710	2711	2	9	None, sir. I have no pheasant,<br>cock nor hen.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2717	2718	2	10	His garments are rich, but he wears them<br>not handsomely.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2724	2727	4	34	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and<br>box which none must know but the King, and<br>which he shall know within this hour if I may come<br>to th’ speech of him.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2729	2729	1	2	Why, sir?
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2734	2735	2	14	So ’tis said, sir—about his son, that should<br>have married a shepherd’s daughter.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2776	2779	4	35	An ’t please you, sir, to<br>undertake the business for us, here is that gold I<br>have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this<br>young man in pawn till I bring it you.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2781	2781	1	2	Ay, sir.
Shepherd_WT	4	4	2800	2801	2	13	Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided<br>to do us good.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3236	3237	2	17	Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy<br>sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3248	3248	1	5	And so have I, boy.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3256	3256	1	8	We may live, son, to shed many more.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3262	3263	2	12	Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle now<br>we are gentlemen.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3270	3270	1	8	You may say it, but not swear it.
Shepherd_WT	5	2	3273	3273	1	6	How if it be false, son?
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1554	1554	1	2	Hilloa, loa!
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1558	1561	4	38	I have seen two such sights, by sea<br>and by land—but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is<br>now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it, you<br>cannot thrust a bodkin’s point.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1563	1577	15	142	I would you did but see how it chafes,<br>how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that’s<br>not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor<br>souls! Sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em.<br>Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast,<br>and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you’d<br>thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land<br>service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone,<br>how he cried to me for help, and said his<br>name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an<br>end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it.<br>But, first, how the poor souls roared and the sea<br>mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared<br>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than<br>the sea or weather.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1579	1582	4	31	Now, now. I have not winked since I<br>saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under<br>water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman.<br>He’s at it now.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1585	1587	3	20	I would you had been by the ship side,<br>to have helped her. There your charity would have<br>lacked footing.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1596	1598	3	21	You’re a made old<br>man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,<br>you’re well to live. Gold, all gold.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1604	1608	5	44	Go you the next way with your<br>findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone from the<br>gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are<br>never curst but when they are hungry. If there be<br>any of him left, I’ll bury it.
ShepherdsSon_WT	3	3	1612	1613	2	13	Marry, will I, and you shall help to<br>put him i’ th’ ground.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1737	1739	3	22	Let me see, every ’leven wether tods,<br>every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen<br>hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1742	1756	15	134	I cannot do ’t without counters. Let<br>me see, what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing<br>feast? Three pound of sugar,<br>five pound of currants, rice—what will this sister of<br>mine do with rice? But my father hath made her<br>mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath<br>made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers,<br>three-man song men all, and very good ones;<br>but they are most of them means and basses, but<br>one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to<br>hornpipes. I must have saffron to color the warden<br>pies; mace; dates, none, that’s out of my note;<br>nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I<br>may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of<br>raisins o’ th’ sun.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1759	1759	1	5	I’ th’ name of me!
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1762	1763	2	18	Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of<br>more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1767	1768	2	13	Alas, poor man, a million of beating<br>may come to a great matter.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1772	1772	1	7	What, by a horseman, or a footman?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1774	1778	5	38	Indeed, he should be a footman by<br>the garments he has left with thee. If this be a<br>horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend<br>me thy hand; I’ll help thee. Come, lend me thy<br>hand.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1780	1780	1	3	Alas, poor soul.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1783	1783	1	4	How now? Canst stand?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1787	1788	2	11	Dost lack any money? I have a little<br>money for thee.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1794	1795	2	9	What manner of fellow was he that<br>robbed you?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1801	1803	3	29	His vices, you would say. There’s no<br>virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to<br>make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1811	1812	2	14	Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig!<br>He haunts wakes, fairs, and bearbaitings.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1815	1817	3	21	Not a more cowardly rogue in all<br>Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him,<br>he’d have run.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1821	1821	1	4	How do you now?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1825	1825	1	7	Shall I bring thee on the way?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	3	1827	1828	2	12	Then fare thee well. I must go buy<br>spices for our sheep-shearing.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2030	2030	1	4	Come on, strike up.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2034	2035	2	13	Not a word, a word. We stand upon our manners.—<br>Come, strike up.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2058	2061	4	34	He could never come better. He shall<br>come in. I love a ballad but even too well if it be<br>doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant<br>thing indeed and sung lamentably.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2074	2076	3	14	Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable<br>conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided<br>wares?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2085	2086	2	9	Prithee bring him in, and let him<br>approach singing.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2089	2090	2	14	You have of these peddlers that have<br>more in them than you’d think, sister.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2105	2108	4	32	If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou<br>shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled<br>as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain<br>ribbons and gloves.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2116	2122	7	58	Is there no manners left among<br>maids? Will they wear their plackets where they<br>should bear their faces? Is there not milking time,<br>when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle<br>of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling<br>before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whisp’ring.<br>Clamor your tongues, and not a word more.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2125	2126	2	17	Have I not told thee how I was cozened<br>by the way and lost all my money?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2129	2130	2	9	Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose<br>nothing here.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2133	2133	1	4	What hast here? Ballads?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2147	2149	3	17	Come on, lay it by, and<br>let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the other<br>things anon.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2161	2161	1	5	Lay it by too. Another.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2190	2195	6	44	We’ll have this song out anon by<br>ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad<br>talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away<br>thy pack after me.—Wenches, I’ll buy for you<br>both.—Peddler, let’s have the first choice.—Follow<br>me, girls.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2648	2651	4	28	See, see, what a man<br>you are now! There is no other way but to tell the<br>King she’s a changeling and none of your flesh and<br>blood.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2653	2653	1	4	Nay, but hear me!
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2655	2661	7	58	She being none of your flesh and<br>blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the<br>King, and so your flesh and blood is not to be<br>punished by him. Show those things you found<br>about her, those secret things, all but what she has<br>with her. This being done, let the law go whistle, I<br>warrant you.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2666	2669	4	27	Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest<br>off you could have been to him, and then your<br>blood had been the dearer by I know how much an<br>ounce.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2675	2675	1	6	Pray heartily he be at’ palace.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2685	2685	1	6	We are but plain fellows, sir.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2691	2693	3	18	Your Worship had like to have given<br>us one, if you had not taken yourself with the<br>manner.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2708	2709	2	11	<span class="" data-words="0"><span class="foreign" data-words="0" data-lang="">Advocate</span></span>’s the<br>court word for a pheasant. Say you have none.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2715	2716	2	7	This cannot be but a<br>great courtier.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2719	2721	3	23	He seems to be the more noble in<br>being fantastical. A great man, I’ll warrant. I know<br>by the picking on ’s teeth.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2740	2740	1	4	Think you so, sir?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2751	2752	2	16	Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you<br>hear, an ’t like you, sir?
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2770	2775	6	51	He seems to be of<br>great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and<br>though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft<br>led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your<br>purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado.<br>Remember: <span class="quote" data-words="1">stoned,</span> and <span class="quote" data-words="2">flayed alive.</span>
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2784	2785	2	22	In some sort, sir; but though my case<br>be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2788	2794	7	57	Comfort, good comfort.<br>We must to the King, and show our strange<br>sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor<br>my sister. We are gone else.—Sir, I will give you as<br>much as this old man does when the business is<br>performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it<br>be brought you.
ShepherdsSon_WT	4	4	2798	2799	2	12	We are blessed in this<br>man, as I may say, even blessed.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3238	3244	7	61	You are well met, sir.<br>You denied to fight with me this other day because I<br>was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say<br>you see them not and think me still no gentleman<br>born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen<br>born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am<br>not now a gentleman born.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3246	3247	2	10	Ay, and have been so any time these<br>four hours.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3249	3255	7	64	So you have—but I was a gentleman<br>born before my father. For the King’s son took me<br>by the hand and called me brother, and then the<br>two kings called my father brother, and then the<br>Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called<br>my father father; and so we wept, and there was the<br>first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3257	3258	2	14	Ay, or else ’twere hard luck, being in<br>so preposterous estate as we are.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3264	3265	2	5	Thou wilt amend thy<br>life?
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3267	3269	3	22	Give me thy hand. I will swear to the<br>Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in<br>Bohemia.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3271	3272	2	17	Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?<br>Let boors and franklins say it; I’ll swear it.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3274	3280	7	72	If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman<br>may swear it in the behalf of his friend.—And<br>I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy<br>hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know<br>thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou<br>wilt be drunk. But I’ll swear it, and I would thou<br>wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
ShepherdsSon_WT	5	2	3282	3287	6	50	Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If<br>I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be<br>drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark,<br>the Kings and Princes, our kindred, are going to see<br>the Queen’s picture. Come, follow us. We’ll be thy<br>good masters.
