Abbess_Err	5	1	1495	1495	1	7	Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
Abbess_Err	5	1	1501	1501	1	8	How long hath this possession held the man?
Abbess_Err	5	1	1506	1511	6	48	Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?<br>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye<br>Strayed his affection in unlawful love,<br>A sin prevailing much in youthful men<br>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?<br>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
Abbess_Err	5	1	1514	1514	1	7	You should for that have reprehended him.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1516	1516	1	5	Ay, but not rough enough.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1518	1518	1	3	Haply in private.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1520	1520	1	4	Ay, but not enough.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1527	1546	20	145	And thereof came it that the man was mad.<br>The venom clamors of a jealous woman<br>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.<br>It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing,<br>And thereof comes it that his head is light.<br>Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy<br>upbraidings.<br>Unquiet meals make ill digestions.<br>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,<br>And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?<br>Thou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls.<br>Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue<br>But moody and dull melancholy,<br>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,<br>And at her heels a huge infectious troop<br>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?<br>In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest<br>To be disturbed would mad or man or beast.<br>The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits<br>Hath scared thy husband from the use of wits.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1553	1553	1	8	No, not a creature enters in my house.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1555	1558	4	31	Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,<br>And it shall privilege him from your hands<br>Till I have brought him to his wits again<br>Or lose my labor in assaying it.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1563	1569	7	56	Be patient, for I will not let him stir<br>Till I have used the approvèd means I have,<br>With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,<br>To make of him a formal man again.<br>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,<br>A charitable duty of my order.<br>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1573	1573	1	9	Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1798	1798	1	8	Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1807	1813	7	53	Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds<br>And gain a husband by his liberty.—<br>Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man<br>That hadst a wife once called Emilia,<br>That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.<br>O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,<br>And speak unto the same Emilia.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1823	1829	7	57	By men of Epidamium he and I<br>And the twin Dromio all were taken up;<br>But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth<br>By force took Dromio and my son from them,<br>And me they left with those of Epidamium.<br>What then became of them I cannot tell;<br>I to this fortune that you see me in.
Abbess_Err	5	1	1863	1876	14	103	Renownèd duke, vouchsafe to take the pains<br>To go with us into the abbey here<br>And hear at large discoursèd all our fortunes,<br>And all that are assembled in this place<br>That by this sympathizèd one day’s error<br>Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company,<br>And we shall make full satisfaction.—<br>Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail<br>Of you, my sons, and till this present hour<br>My heavy burden ne’er deliverèd.—<br>The Duke, my husband, and my children both,<br>And you, the calendars of their nativity,<br>Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me.<br>After so long grief, such nativity!
Adriana_Err	2	1	267	269	3	23	Neither my husband nor the slave returned<br>That in such haste I sent to seek his master?<br>Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.
Adriana_Err	2	1	276	276	1	8	Why should their liberty than ours be more?
Adriana_Err	2	1	278	278	1	10	Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
Adriana_Err	2	1	280	280	1	8	There’s none but asses will be bridled so.
Adriana_Err	2	1	292	292	1	7	This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
Adriana_Err	2	1	294	294	1	9	But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
Adriana_Err	2	1	296	296	1	7	How if your husband start some otherwhere?
Adriana_Err	2	1	298	307	10	82	Patience unmoved! No marvel though she pause;<br>They can be meek that have no other cause.<br>A wretched soul bruised with adversity<br>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,<br>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,<br>As much or more we should ourselves complain.<br>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,<br>With urging helpless patience would relieve me;<br>But if thou live to see like right bereft,<br>This fool-begged patience in thee will be left.
Adriana_Err	2	1	310	310	1	8	Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Adriana_Err	2	1	313	314	2	10	Say, didst thou speak with him? Know’st thou his<br>mind?
Adriana_Err	2	1	322	323	2	18	But say, I prithee, is he coming home?<br>It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
Adriana_Err	2	1	325	325	1	4	Horn mad, thou villain?
Adriana_Err	2	1	346	346	1	9	Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
Adriana_Err	2	1	349	349	1	9	Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
Adriana_Err	2	1	352	352	1	7	Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.
Adriana_Err	2	1	358	372	15	119	His company must do his minions grace,<br>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br>Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took<br>From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.<br>Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?<br>If voluble and sharp discourse be marred,<br>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.<br>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?<br>That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.<br>What ruins are in me that can be found<br>By him not ruined? Then is he the ground<br>Of my defeatures. My decayèd fair<br>A sunny look of his would soon repair.<br>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale<br>And feeds from home. Poor I am but his stale.
Adriana_Err	2	1	374	386	13	103	Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,<br>Or else what lets it but he would be here?<br>Sister, you know he promised me a chain.<br>Would that alone o’ love he would detain,<br>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.<br>I see the jewel best enamelèd<br>Will lose his beauty. Yet the gold bides still<br>That others touch, and often touching will<br>Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name<br>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.<br>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.
Adriana_Err	2	2	507	544	38	289	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.<br>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.<br>I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.<br>The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow<br>That never words were music to thine ear,<br>That never object pleasing in thine eye,<br>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,<br>That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste,<br>Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to<br>thee.<br>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it<br>That thou art then estrangèd from thyself?<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">Thyself</span> I call it, being strange to me,<br>That, undividable, incorporate,<br>Am better than thy dear self’s better part.<br>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!<br>For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall<br>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,<br>And take unmingled thence that drop again<br>Without addition or diminishing,<br>As take from me thyself and not me too.<br>How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,<br>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious<br>And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br>By ruffian lust should be contaminate!<br>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,<br>And hurl the name of husband in my face,<br>And tear the stained skin off my harlot brow,<br>And from my false hand cut the wedding ring,<br>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?<br>I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.<br>I am possessed with an adulterate blot;<br>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;<br>For if we two be one, and thou play false,<br>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,<br>Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br>Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,<br>I live distained, thou undishonorèd.
Adriana_Err	2	2	555	557	3	27	By thee; and this thou didst return from him:<br>That he did buffet thee and, in his blows,<br>Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
Adriana_Err	2	2	566	578	13	107	How ill agrees it with your gravity<br>To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,<br>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood.<br>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,<br>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.<br>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine.<br>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,<br>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,<br>Makes me with thy strength to communicate.<br>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,<br>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,<br>Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion<br>Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
Adriana_Err	2	2	603	611	9	76	Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,<br>To put the finger in the eye and weep<br>Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.<br>Come, sir, to dinner.—Dromio, keep the gate.—<br>Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,<br>And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.<br>Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,<br>Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.—<br>Come, sister.—Dromio, play the porter well.
Adriana_Err	2	2	618	618	1	10	Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
Adriana_Err	3	1	713	713	1	11	Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?
Adriana_Err	3	1	717	717	1	10	Your wife, sir knave? Go, get you from the door.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1110	1115	6	48	Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?<br>Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye<br>That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?<br>Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?<br>What observation mad’st thou in this case<br>Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1117	1117	1	10	He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1119	1119	1	9	And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1121	1121	1	4	And what said he?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1123	1123	1	8	With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1126	1126	1	4	Did’st speak him fair?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1128	1133	6	41	I cannot, nor I will not hold me still.<br>My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.<br>He is deformèd, crooked, old, and sere,<br>Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere,<br>Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,<br>Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1136	1140	5	35	Ah, but I think him better than I say,<br>And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse.<br>Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.<br>My heart prays for him, though my tongue do<br>curse.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1145	1145	1	8	Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1158	1158	1	6	Why, man, what is the matter?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1160	1160	1	9	What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1166	1168	3	27	Go fetch it, sister. This I wonder at,<br>That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.<br>Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1171	1171	1	3	What, the chain?
Adriana_Err	4	2	1175	1175	1	9	The hours come back. That did I never hear.
Adriana_Err	4	2	1178	1179	2	11	As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou<br>reason!
Adriana_Err	4	2	1187	1190	4	30	Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight,<br>And bring thy master home immediately.<br>Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:<br>Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1338	1341	4	28	His incivility confirms no less.—<br>Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;<br>Establish him in his true sense again,<br>And I will please you what you will demand.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1351	1351	1	8	O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!
Adriana_Err	4	4	1357	1359	3	25	O husband, God doth know you dined at home,<br>Where would you had remained until this time,<br>Free from these slanders and this open shame.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1372	1372	1	9	Is ’t good to soothe him in these contraries?
Adriana_Err	4	4	1376	1377	2	17	Alas, I sent you money to redeem you<br>By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1381	1381	1	8	He came to me, and I delivered it.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1391	1391	1	8	I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1394	1394	1	7	Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1400	1400	1	11	O bind him, bind him! Let him not come near me.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1409	1411	3	21	What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?<br>Hast thou delight to see a wretched man<br>Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
Adriana_Err	4	4	1414	1418	5	40	I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.<br>Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,<br>And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.—<br>Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed<br>Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
Adriana_Err	4	4	1426	1428	3	35	Go bear him hence.<br>Sister, go you with me.<br>Say now whose suit is he arrested at.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1430	1430	1	10	I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
Adriana_Err	4	4	1432	1432	1	5	Say, how grows it due?
Adriana_Err	4	4	1434	1434	1	11	He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1439	1441	3	27	It may be so, but I did never see it.—<br>Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is.<br>I long to know the truth hereof at large.
Adriana_Err	4	4	1443	1444	2	14	And come with naked swords. Let’s call more help<br>To have them bound again.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1490	1492	3	27	Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.—<br>Some get within him; take his sword away.<br>Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house!
Adriana_Err	5	1	1496	1498	3	24	To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.<br>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast<br>And bear him home for his recovery.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1502	1505	4	28	This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,<br>And much different from the man he was.<br>But till this afternoon his passion<br>Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1512	1513	2	18	To none of these, except it be the last,<br>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1515	1515	1	4	Why, so I did.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1517	1517	1	8	As roughly as my modesty would let me.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1519	1519	1	4	And in assemblies too.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1521	1526	6	49	It was the copy of our conference.<br>In bed he slept not for my urging it;<br>At board he fed not for my urging it.<br>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;<br>In company I often glancèd it.<br>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1551	1552	2	16	She did betray me to my own reproof.—<br>Good people, enter and lay hold on him.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1554	1554	1	8	Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1559	1562	4	32	I will attend my husband, be his nurse,<br>Diet his sickness, for it is my office<br>And will have no attorney but myself;<br>And therefore let me have him home with me.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1570	1572	3	23	I will not hence and leave my husband here;<br>And ill it doth beseem your holiness<br>To separate the husband and the wife.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1575	1578	4	34	Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet<br>And never rise until my tears and prayers<br>Have won his grace to come in person hither<br>And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1594	1594	1	7	Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1597	1621	25	205	May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,<br>Who I made lord of me and all I had<br>At your important letters, this ill day<br>A most outrageous fit of madness took him,<br>That desp’rately he hurried through the street,<br>With him his bondman, all as mad as he,<br>Doing displeasure to the citizens<br>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence<br>Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.<br>Once did I get him bound and sent him home<br>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went<br>That here and there his fury had committed.<br>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,<br>He broke from those that had the guard of him,<br>And with his mad attendant and himself,<br>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,<br>Met us again and, madly bent on us,<br>Chased us away, till raising of more aid,<br>We came again to bind them. Then they fled<br>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,<br>And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us<br>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,<br>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.<br>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command<br>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1640	1641	2	18	Peace, fool. Thy master and his man are here,<br>And that is false thou dost report to us.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1649	1652	4	32	Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you<br>That he is borne about invisible.<br>Even now we housed him in the abbey here,<br>And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1670	1672	3	25	No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister<br>Today did dine together. So befall my soul<br>As this is false he burdens me withal.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1799	1799	1	9	I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
Adriana_Err	5	1	1837	1837	1	9	Which of you two did dine with me today?
Adriana_Err	5	1	1839	1839	1	6	And are not you my husband?
Adriana_Err	5	1	1851	1852	2	18	I sent you money, sir, to be your bail<br>By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
Angelo_Err	3	1	720	721	2	12	Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would<br>fain have either.
Angelo_Err	3	1	790	790	1	9	I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Angelo_Err	3	2	973	973	1	2	Master Antipholus.
Angelo_Err	3	2	975	977	3	26	I know it well, sir. Lo, here’s the chain.<br>I thought to have ta’en you at the Porpentine;<br>The chain unfinished made me stay thus long.
Angelo_Err	3	2	979	979	1	10	What please yourself, sir. I have made it for you.
Angelo_Err	3	2	981	984	4	34	Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.<br>Go home with it, and please your wife withal,<br>And soon at supper time I’ll visit you<br>And then receive my money for the chain.
Angelo_Err	3	2	987	987	1	9	You are a merry man, sir. Fare you well.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1001	1007	7	60	Even just the sum that I do owe to you<br>Is growing to me by Antipholus.<br>And in the instant that I met with you,<br>He had of me a chain. At five o’clock<br>I shall receive the money for the same.<br>Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,<br>I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1021	1027	7	56	Saving your merry humor, here’s the note<br>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,<br>The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,<br>Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more<br>Than I stand debted to this gentleman.<br>I pray you, see him presently discharged,<br>For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1034	1034	1	9	Then you will bring the chain to her yourself.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1036	1036	1	10	Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
Angelo_Err	4	1	1039	1041	3	28	Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.<br>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,<br>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1047	1047	1	8	You hear how he importunes me. The chain!
Angelo_Err	4	1	1049	1050	2	20	Come, come. You know I gave it you even now.<br>Either send the chain, or send by me some token.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1057	1057	1	9	The money that you owe me for the chain.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1059	1059	1	10	You know I gave it you half an hour since.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1061	1062	2	15	You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.<br>Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1066	1068	3	20	This touches me in reputation.<br>Either consent to pay this sum for me,<br>Or I attach you by this officer.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1071	1073	3	25	Here is thy fee. Arrest him, officer.<br>I would not spare my brother in this case<br>If he should scorn me so apparently.
Angelo_Err	4	1	1079	1080	2	16	Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,<br>To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1458	1460	3	25	I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,<br>But I protest he had the chain of me,<br>Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1462	1465	4	28	Of very reverend reputation, sir,<br>Of credit infinite, highly beloved,<br>Second to none that lives here in the city.<br>His word might bear my wealth at any time.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1467	1479	13	103	’Tis so, and that self chain about his neck<br>Which he forswore most monstrously to have.<br>Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.—<br>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much<br>That you would put me to this shame and trouble,<br>And not without some scandal to yourself,<br>With circumstance and oaths so to deny<br>This chain, which now you wear so openly.<br>Besides the charge, the shame, imprisonment,<br>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,<br>Who, but for staying on our controversy,<br>Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.<br>This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?
Angelo_Err	5	1	1499	1499	1	9	I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1584	1584	1	3	Upon what cause?
Angelo_Err	5	1	1589	1589	1	9	See where they come. We will behold his death.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1675	1676	2	14	O perjured woman!—They are both forsworn.<br>In this the madman justly chargeth them.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1719	1720	2	20	My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:<br>That he dined not at home, but was locked out.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1722	1723	2	18	He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,<br>These people saw the chain about his neck.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1847	1847	1	10	That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
Angelo_Err	5	1	1850	1850	1	9	I think I did, sir. I deny it not.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	620	629	10	88	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;<br>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.<br>Say that I lingered with you at your shop<br>To see the making of her carcanet,<br>And that tomorrow you will bring it home.<br>But here’s a villain that would face me down<br>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him<br>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,<br>And that I did deny my wife and house.—<br>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	636	636	1	6	I think thou art an ass.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	641	643	3	17	You’re sad, Signior Balthasar. Pray God our cheer<br>May answer my goodwill and your good welcome<br>here.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	646	648	3	18	O Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish<br>A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty<br>dish.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	650	651	2	9	And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but<br>words.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	654	660	7	50	Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.<br>But though my cates be mean, take them in good<br>part.<br>Better cheer may you have, but not with better<br>heart.<br>But soft! My door is locked. Go, bid<br>them let us in.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	673	673	1	8	Who talks within there? Ho, open the door.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	676	676	1	9	Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	679	680	2	12	What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I<br>owe?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	701	701	1	11	Do you hear, you minion? You’ll let us in, I hope?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	706	706	1	5	Thou baggage, let me in.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	710	710	1	11	You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	716	716	1	9	Are you there, wife? You might have come before.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	726	727	2	11	There is something in the wind, that we cannot get<br>in.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	734	734	1	9	Go, fetch me something. I’ll break ope the gate.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	746	746	1	9	Well, I’ll break in. Go, borrow me a crow.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	752	752	1	9	Go, get thee gone. Fetch me an iron crow.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	775	789	15	125	You have prevailed. I will depart in quiet<br>And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.<br>I know a wench of excellent discourse,<br>Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.<br>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,<br>My wife—but, I protest, without desert—<br>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;<br>To her will we to dinner. Get you home<br>And fetch the chain; by this, I know, ’tis made.<br>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,<br>For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow—<br>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife—<br>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.<br>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,<br>I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	3	1	791	791	1	9	Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1009	1014	6	52	While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou<br>And buy a rope’s end. That will I bestow<br>Among my wife and her confederates<br>For locking me out of my doors by day.<br>But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone.<br>Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1016	1020	5	43	A man is well holp up that trusts to you!<br>I promisèd your presence and the chain,<br>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.<br>Belike you thought our love would last too long<br>If it were chained together, and therefore came not.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1028	1033	6	50	I am not furnished with the present money.<br>Besides, I have some business in the town.<br>Good signior, take the stranger to my house,<br>And with you take the chain, and bid my wife<br>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.<br>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1035	1035	1	11	No, bear it with you lest I come not time enough.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1037	1038	2	18	An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,<br>Or else you may return without your money.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1042	1045	4	33	Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse<br>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.<br>I should have chid you for not bringing it,<br>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1048	1048	1	10	Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1051	1052	2	20	Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.<br>Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1056	1056	1	8	I answer you? What should I answer you?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1058	1058	1	9	I owe you none till I receive the chain.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1060	1060	1	11	You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1069	1070	2	15	Consent to pay thee that I never had?—<br>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1075	1078	4	29	I do obey thee till I give thee bail.<br>But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as<br>dear<br>As all the metal in your shop will answer.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1089	1090	2	15	How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,<br>What ship of Epidamium stays for me?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1092	1093	2	18	Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope<br>And told thee to what purpose and what end.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1096	1104	9	78	I will debate this matter at more leisure<br>And teach your ears to list me with more heed.<br>To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight.<br>Give her this key, and tell her in the desk<br>That’s covered o’er with Turkish tapestry<br>There is a purse of ducats. Let her send it.<br>Tell her I am arrested in the street,<br>And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave. Begone.—<br>On, officer, to prison till it come.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1289	1298	10	86	Fear me not, man. I will not break away.<br>I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,<br>To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.<br>My wife is in a wayward mood today<br>And will not lightly trust the messenger<br>That I should be attached in Ephesus.<br>I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.<br>Here comes my man. I think he brings the<br>money.<br>How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1300	1300	1	4	But where’s the money?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1302	1302	1	7	Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1304	1304	1	10	To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1307	1307	1	9	And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1314	1315	2	4	Thou whoreson, senseless<br>villain.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1318	1319	2	12	Thou art sensible in nothing<br>but blows, and so is an ass.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1332	1332	1	8	Come, go along. My wife is coming yonder.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1336	1336	1	4	Wilt thou still talk?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1345	1345	1	10	There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1350	1350	1	8	Peace, doting wizard, peace. I am not mad.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1352	1356	5	38	You minion, you, are these your customers?<br>Did this companion with the saffron face<br>Revel and feast it at my house today<br>Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut<br>And I denied to enter in my house?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1360	1361	2	10	<span class="quote" data-words="3">Dined at home</span>? Thou villain, what<br>sayest thou?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1363	1363	1	10	Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1365	1365	1	8	And did not she herself revile me there?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1367	1367	1	10	Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1369	1369	1	9	And did not I in rage depart from thence?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1375	1375	1	8	Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1380	1380	1	10	Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1388	1390	3	21	Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today.<br>And why dost thou deny the<br>bag of gold?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1395	1399	5	40	Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,<br>And art confederate with a damnèd pack<br>To make a loathsome abject scorn of me.<br>But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes<br>That would behold in me this shameful sport.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1403	1405	3	20	What, will you murder me?—Thou jailer, thou,<br>I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them<br>To make a rescue?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1419	1419	1	4	O most unhappy strumpet!
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1421	1421	1	9	Out on thee, villain! Wherefore dost thou mad me?
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1653	1657	5	47	Justice, most gracious duke. O, grant me justice,<br>Even for the service that long since I did thee<br>When I bestrid thee in the wars and took<br>Deep scars to save thy life. Even for the blood<br>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1660	1665	6	45	Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there,<br>She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife,<br>That hath abusèd and dishonored me<br>Even in the strength and height of injury.<br>Beyond imagination is the wrong<br>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1667	1668	2	18	This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me<br>While she with harlots feasted in my house.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1677	1718	42	316	My liege, I am advisèd what I say,<br>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,<br>Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire,<br>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.<br>This woman locked me out this day from dinner.<br>That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her,<br>Could witness it, for he was with me then,<br>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,<br>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>Where Balthasar and I did dine together.<br>Our dinner done and he not coming thither,<br>I went to seek him. In the street I met him,<br>And in his company that gentleman.<br>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down<br>That I this day of him received the chain,<br>Which, God He knows, I saw not; for the which<br>He did arrest me with an officer.<br>I did obey and sent my peasant home<br>For certain ducats. He with none returned.<br>Then fairly I bespoke the officer<br>To go in person with me to my house.<br>By th’ way we met<br>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more<br>Of vile confederates. Along with them<br>They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced<br>villain,<br>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,<br>A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,<br>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,<br>A living dead man. This pernicious slave,<br>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,<br>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,<br>Cries out I was possessed. Then all together<br>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,<br>And in a dark and dankish vault at home<br>There left me and my man, both bound together,<br>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>I gained my freedom and immediately<br>Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech<br>To give me ample satisfaction<br>For these deep shames and great indignities.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1730	1733	4	33	I never came within these abbey walls,<br>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.<br>I never saw the chain, so help me heaven,<br>And this is false you burden me withal.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1744	1744	1	10	’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1763	1763	1	9	I never saw you in my life till now.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1768	1768	1	1	Neither.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1787	1787	1	8	I never saw my father in my life.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1791	1793	3	26	The Duke and all that know me in the city<br>Can witness with me that it is not so.<br>I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1833	1833	1	8	I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1835	1836	2	15	Brought to this town by that most famous warrior<br>Duke Menaphon, your most renownèd uncle.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1840	1840	1	6	No, I say nay to that.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1849	1849	1	8	And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1859	1859	1	8	These ducats pawn I for my father here.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1862	1862	1	10	There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.
AntipholusOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1879	1879	1	8	Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	167	174	8	61	Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,<br>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br>Within this hour it will be dinnertime.<br>Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,<br>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br>And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br>Get thee away.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	177	181	5	41	A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,<br>When I am dull with care and melancholy,<br>Lightens my humor with his merry jests.<br>What, will you walk with me about the town<br>And then go to my inn and dine with me?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	188	189	2	17	Farewell till then. I will go lose myself<br>And wander up and down to view the city.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	191	200	10	82	He that commends me to mine own content<br>Commends me to the thing I cannot get.<br>I to the world am like a drop of water<br>That in the ocean seeks another drop,<br>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,<br>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.<br>So I, to find a mother and a brother,<br>In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.<br>Here comes the almanac of my true date.—<br>What now? How chance thou art returned so soon?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	211	212	2	20	Stop in your wind, sir. Tell me this, I pray:<br>Where have you left the money that I gave you?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	216	219	4	33	I am not in a sportive humor now.<br>Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?<br>We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust<br>So great a charge from thine own custody?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	227	229	3	27	Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.<br>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.<br>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	231	232	2	17	Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,<br>And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	236	240	5	43	Now, as I am a Christian, answer me<br>In what safe place you have bestowed my money,<br>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours<br>That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.<br>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	246	247	2	8	Thy mistress’ marks? What mistress, slave, hast<br>thou?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	251	252	2	17	What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,<br>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	256	266	11	80	Upon my life, by some device or other<br>The villain is o’erraught of all my money.<br>They say this town is full of cozenage,<br>As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,<br>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,<br>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,<br>Disguisèd cheaters, prating mountebanks,<br>And many suchlike liberties of sin.<br>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.<br>I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.<br>I greatly fear my money is not safe.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	388	399	12	106	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up<br>Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave<br>Is wandered forth in care to seek me out.<br>By computation and mine host’s report,<br>I could not speak with Dromio since at first<br>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.<br>How now, sir? Is your merry humor altered?<br>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.<br>You know no Centaur? You received no gold?<br>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?<br>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,<br>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	401	401	1	9	Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	404	406	3	25	Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt<br>And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner,<br>For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeased.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	409	410	2	20	Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?<br>Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that and that.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	413	421	9	73	Because that I familiarly sometimes<br>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,<br>Your sauciness will jest upon my love<br>And make a common of my serious hours.<br>When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,<br>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.<br>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,<br>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,<br>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	428	428	1	4	Dost thou not know?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	431	431	1	5	Shall I tell you why?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	434	436	3	16	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Why</span> first: for flouting<br>me; and then <span class="quote" data-words="1">wherefore</span>: for urging it the second<br>time to me.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	441	441	1	5	Thank me, sir, for what?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	444	446	3	17	I’ll make you amends next,<br>to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it<br>dinnertime?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	449	450	2	6	In good time, sir, what’s<br>that?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	452	452	1	6	Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	455	455	1	2	Your reason?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	458	459	2	14	Well, sir, learn to jest in<br>good time. There’s a time for all things.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	462	462	1	4	By what rule, sir?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	465	465	1	3	Let’s hear it.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	468	469	2	9	May he not do it by fine and<br>recovery?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	472	473	2	16	Why is Time such a niggard<br>of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	477	478	2	11	Why, but there’s many a<br>man hath more hair than wit.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	481	482	2	10	Why, thou didst conclude<br>hairy men plain dealers without wit.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	485	485	1	3	For what reason?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	487	487	1	6	Nay, not sound, I pray you.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	489	490	2	7	Nay, not sure, in a thing<br>falsing.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	492	492	1	2	Name them.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	496	497	2	14	You would all this time<br>have proved there is no time for all things.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	500	501	2	13	But your reason was not<br>substantial why there is no time to recover.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	505	506	2	13	I knew ’twould be a bald<br>conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	545	549	5	44	Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not.<br>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,<br>As strange unto your town as to your talk,<br>Who, every word by all my wit being scanned,<br>Wants wit in all one word to understand.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	553	553	1	2	By Dromio?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	558	559	2	16	Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?<br>What is the course and drift of your compact?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	561	562	2	16	Villain, thou liest, for even her very words<br>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	564	565	2	15	How can she thus then call us by our names—<br>Unless it be by inspiration?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	579	584	6	48	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.<br>What, was I married to her in my dream?<br>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?<br>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?<br>Until I know this sure uncertainty<br>I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	595	595	1	10	I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	597	597	1	5	Thou hast thine own form.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	612	616	5	38	Am I in Earth, in heaven, or in hell?<br>Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advised?<br>Known unto these, and to myself disguised!<br>Ill say as they say, and persever so,<br>And in this mist at all adventures go.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	822	845	24	205	Sweet mistress—what your name is else I know not,<br>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine—<br>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not<br>Than our Earth’s wonder, more than Earth divine.<br>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.<br>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,<br>Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,<br>The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.<br>Against my soul’s pure truth why labor you<br>To make it wander in an unknown field?<br>Are you a god? Would you create me new?<br>Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.<br>But if that I am I, then well I know<br>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.<br>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.<br>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note<br>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.<br>Sing, Siren, for thyself, and I will dote.<br>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,<br>And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie,<br>And in that glorious supposition think<br>He gains by death that hath such means to die.<br>Let love, being light, be drownèd if she sink.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	847	847	1	9	Not mad, but mated—how, I do not know.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	849	849	1	9	For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	852	852	1	10	As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	854	854	1	3	Thy sister’s sister.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	856	860	5	35	No,<br>It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,<br>Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,<br>My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim,<br>My sole Earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	862	865	4	31	Call thyself <span class="quote" data-words="1">sister,</span> sweet, for I am thee.<br>Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;<br>Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.<br>Give me thy hand.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	868	869	2	9	Why, how now, Dromio.<br>Where runn’st thou so fast?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	872	873	2	10	Thou art Dromio, thou art<br>my man, thou art thyself.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	876	877	2	7	What woman’s man? And<br>how besides thyself?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	881	881	1	6	What claim lays she to thee?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	887	887	1	3	What is she?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	892	892	2	7	How dost thou mean a <span class="quote" data-words="2">fatmarriage</span>?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	901	901	1	5	What complexion is she of?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	905	906	2	7	That’s a fault that water will<br>mend.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	909	909	1	3	What’s her name?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	913	914	2	5	Then she bears some<br>breadth?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	918	919	2	8	In what part of her body<br>stands Ireland?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	922	922	1	2	Where Scotland?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	925	925	1	2	Where France?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	928	928	1	2	Where England?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	933	933	1	2	Where Spain?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	936	936	1	4	Where America, the Indies?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	942	943	2	5	Where stood Belgia, the<br>Netherlands?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	955	961	7	61	Go, hie thee presently. Post to the road.<br>An if the wind blow any way from shore,<br>I will not harbor in this town tonight.<br>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,<br>Where I will walk till thou return to me.<br>If everyone knows us, and we know none,<br>’Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	964	972	9	70	There’s none but witches do inhabit here,<br>And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.<br>She that doth call me husband, even my soul<br>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,<br>Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace,<br>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,<br>Hath almost made me traitor to myself.<br>But lest myself be guilty to self wrong,<br>I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	974	974	1	4	Ay, that’s my name,
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	978	978	1	10	What is your will that I shall do with this?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	980	980	1	9	Made it for me, sir? I bespoke it not.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	985	986	2	17	I pray you, sir, receive the money now,<br>For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	988	994	7	63	What I should think of this I cannot tell,<br>But this I think: there’s no man is so vain<br>That would refuse so fair an offered chain.<br>I see a man here needs not live by shifts<br>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.<br>I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.<br>If any ship put out, then straight away.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1191	1201	11	83	There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me<br>As if I were their well-acquainted friend,<br>And everyone doth call me by my name.<br>Some tender money to me; some invite me;<br>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;<br>Some offer me commodities to buy.<br>Even now a tailor called me in his shop<br>And showed me silks that he had bought for me,<br>And therewithal took measure of my body.<br>Sure these are but imaginary wiles,<br>And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1205	1205	1	9	What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1211	1211	1	4	I understand thee not.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1219	1220	2	5	What, thou mean’st an<br>officer?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1225	1227	3	18	Well, sir, there rest in your<br>foolery. Is there any ships puts forth tonight? May<br>we be gone?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1233	1235	3	21	The fellow is distract, and so am I,<br>And here we wander in illusions.<br>Some blessèd power deliver us from hence!
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1239	1239	1	8	Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1241	1241	1	4	It is the devil.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1254	1254	1	2	Why, Dromio?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1257	1259	3	26	Avoid then, fiend! What tell’st thou me of supping?<br>Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress.<br>I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1270	1270	1	8	Avaunt, thou witch!—Come, Dromio, let us go.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	4	1446	1446	1	8	I see these witches are afraid of swords.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	4	1448	1449	2	18	Come to the Centaur. Fetch our stuff from thence.<br>I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	4	4	1456	1457	2	16	I will not stay tonight for all the town.<br>Therefore, away, to get our stuff aboard.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1480	1480	1	9	I think I had. I never did deny it.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1482	1482	1	9	Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1486	1488	3	22	Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.<br>I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty<br>Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1805	1805	1	8	Egeon art thou not, or else his ghost?
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1831	1831	1	8	No, sir, not I. I came from Syracuse.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1838	1838	1	3	I, gentle mistress.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1841	1846	6	47	And so do I, yet did she call me so,<br>And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,<br>Did call me brother. What I told you<br>then<br>I hope I shall have leisure to make good,<br>If this be not a dream I see and hear.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1848	1848	1	9	I think it be, sir. I deny it not.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1854	1858	5	41	This purse of ducats I received from you,<br>And Dromio my man did bring them me.<br>I see we still did meet each other’s man,<br>And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,<br>And thereupon these errors are arose.
AntipholusOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1881	1883	3	25	He speaks to me.—I am your master, Dromio.<br>Come, go with us. We’ll look to that anon.<br>Embrace thy brother there. Rejoice with him.
Balthasar_Err	3	1	644	645	2	10	I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome<br>dear.
Balthasar_Err	3	1	649	649	1	9	Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
Balthasar_Err	3	1	652	653	2	9	Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry<br>feast.
Balthasar_Err	3	1	722	723	2	10	In debating which was best, we shall part with<br>neither.
Balthasar_Err	3	1	753	774	22	164	Have patience, sir. O, let it not be so.<br>Herein you war against your reputation,<br>And draw within the compass of suspect<br>Th’ unviolated honor of your wife.<br>Once this: your long experience of her wisdom,<br>Her sober virtue, years, and modesty<br>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown.<br>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse<br>Why at this time the doors are made against you.<br>Be ruled by me; depart in patience,<br>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,<br>And about evening come yourself alone<br>To know the reason of this strange restraint.<br>If by strong hand you offer to break in<br>Now in the stirring passage of the day,<br>A vulgar comment will be made of it;<br>And that supposèd by the common rout<br>Against your yet ungallèd estimation<br>That may with foul intrusion enter in<br>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br>For slander lives upon succession,<br>Forever housèd where it gets possession.
Courtesan_Err	4	3	1236	1238	3	23	Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.<br>I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.<br>Is that the chain you promised me today?
Courtesan_Err	4	3	1250	1251	2	18	Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.<br>Will you go with me? We’ll mend our dinner here.
Courtesan_Err	4	3	1260	1262	3	27	Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner<br>Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,<br>And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Courtesan_Err	4	3	1268	1269	2	20	I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain.<br>I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
Courtesan_Err	4	3	1273	1288	16	129	Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad;<br>Else would he never so demean himself.<br>A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,<br>And for the same he promised me a chain.<br>Both one and other he denies me now.<br>The reason that I gather he is mad,<br>Besides this present instance of his rage,<br>Is a mad tale he told today at dinner<br>Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.<br>Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,<br>On purpose shut the doors against his way.<br>My way is now to hie home to his house<br>And tell his wife that, being lunatic,<br>He rushed into my house and took perforce<br>My ring away. This course I fittest choose,<br>For forty ducats is too much to lose.
Courtesan_Err	4	4	1337	1337	1	9	How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
Courtesan_Err	4	4	1343	1343	1	7	Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
Courtesan_Err	4	4	1435	1438	4	33	Whenas your husband all in rage today<br>Came to my house and took away my ring,<br>The ring I saw upon his finger now,<br>Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
Courtesan_Err	5	1	1743	1743	1	9	He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.
Courtesan_Err	5	1	1746	1746	1	10	As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
Courtesan_Err	5	1	1861	1861	1	8	Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	201	210	10	83	Returned so soon? Rather approached too late!<br>The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit;<br>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br>My mistress made it one upon my cheek.<br>She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br>The meat is cold because you come not home;<br>You come not home because you have no stomach;<br>You have no stomach, having broke your fast.<br>But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray<br>Are penitent for your default today.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	213	215	3	25	O, sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last<br>To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?<br>The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	220	226	7	52	I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.<br>I from my mistress come to you in post;<br>If I return, I shall be post indeed,<br>For she will scour your fault upon my pate.<br>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your<br>clock,<br>And strike you home without a messenger.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	230	230	1	10	To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me!
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	233	235	3	27	My charge was but to fetch you from the mart<br>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.<br>My mistress and her sister stays for you.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	241	245	5	40	I have some marks of yours upon my pate,<br>Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders,<br>But not a thousand marks between you both.<br>If I should pay your Worship those again,<br>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	248	250	3	28	Your Worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix,<br>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner<br>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	1	2	253	255	3	20	What mean you, sir? For God’s sake, hold your<br>hands.<br>Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	311	312	2	14	Nay, he’s at two hands with me,<br>and that my two ears can witness.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	315	316	2	17	Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.<br>Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	319	321	3	22	Nay, he struck so plainly I could<br>too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully<br>that I could scarce understand them.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	324	324	1	8	Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	326	337	13	93	I mean not cuckold mad,<br>But sure he is stark mad.<br>When I desired him to come home to dinner,<br>He asked me for a thousand marks in gold.<br><span class="quote" data-words="2">’Tis dinnertime,</span> quoth I. <span class="quote" data-words="2">My gold,</span> quoth he.<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Your meat doth burn,</span> quoth I. <span class="quote" data-words="2">My gold,</span> quoth<br>he.<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">Will you come?</span> quoth I. <span class="quote" data-words="2">My gold,</span> quoth he.<br><span class="quote" data-words="9">Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?</span><br><span class="quote" data-words="2">The pig,</span> quoth I, <span class="quote" data-words="2">is burned.</span> <span class="quote" data-words="2">My gold,</span> quoth<br>he.<br><span class="quote" data-words="3">My mistress, sir,</span> quoth I. <span class="quote" data-words="13">Hang up thy mistress!I know not thy mistress. Out on thy mistress!</span>
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	340	344	6	38	Quoth my master.<br><span class="quote" data-words="2">I know,</span> quoth he, <span class="quote" data-words="6">no house, no wife, nomistress.</span><br>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,<br>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders,<br>For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	347	348	2	15	Go back again and be new beaten home?<br>For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	350	351	2	17	And he will bless that cross with other beating.<br>Between you, I shall have a holy head.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	2	1	353	356	4	41	Am I so round with you as you with me,<br>That like a football you do spurn me thus?<br>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.<br>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	630	635	6	45	Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.<br>That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to<br>show;<br>If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave<br>were ink,<br>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	637	640	4	36	Marry, so it doth appear<br>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.<br>I should kick being kicked and, being at that pass,<br>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	661	661	1	6	Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	669	670	2	12	What patch is made our porter? My master stays in<br>the street.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	683	689	7	45	O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my<br>name!<br>The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle<br>blame.<br>If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,<br>Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or<br>thy name for an ass.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	692	692	1	5	Let my master in, Luce.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	695	696	2	17	O Lord, I must laugh.<br>Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	704	705	2	10	So, come help. Well struck! There was blow for<br>blow.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	708	708	1	5	Master, knock the door hard.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	718	719	2	11	If you went in pain, master, this knave would go<br>sore.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	724	725	2	10	They stand at the door, master. Bid them welcome<br>hither.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	728	733	6	37	You would say so, master, if your garments were<br>thin.<br>Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in<br>the cold.<br>It would make a man mad as a buck to be so<br>bought and sold.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	737	740	4	27	A man may break a word with you, sir, and words<br>are but wind,<br>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not<br>behind.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	742	743	2	12	Here’s too much <span class="quote" data-words="3">Out upon thee!</span> I pray thee, let<br>me in.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	3	1	747	751	5	32	A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?<br>For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a<br>feather.—<br>If a crow help us in, sirrah, well pluck a crow<br>together.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	1	1015	1015	1	11	I buy a thousand pound a year! I buy a rope!
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1299	1299	1	9	Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1301	1301	1	9	Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1303	1303	1	9	I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1305	1306	2	12	To a rope’s end, sir, and to that<br>end am I returned.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1309	1310	2	11	Nay, ’tis for me to be patient. I am<br>in adversity.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1312	1313	2	8	Nay, rather persuade him to hold<br>his hands.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1316	1317	2	13	I would I were senseless, sir, that<br>I might not feel your blows.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1320	1331	12	117	I am an ass, indeed; you may<br>prove it by my long ears.—I have served him from<br>the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have<br>nothing at his hands for my service but blows.<br>When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I<br>am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked<br>with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit,<br>driven out of doors with it when I go from home,<br>welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it<br>on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I<br>think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it<br>from door to door.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1333	1335	3	17	Mistress, <span class="foreign" data-words="2" data-lang="la">respice finem</span>, respect<br>your end, or rather, the prophecy like the parrot,<br><span class="quote" data-words="4">Beware the rope’s end.</span>
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1362	1362	1	10	Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1364	1364	1	9	Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1366	1366	1	7	Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1368	1368	1	8	Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1370	1371	2	17	In verity you did.—My bones bears witness,<br>That since have felt the vigor of his rage.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1378	1379	2	16	Money by me? Heart and goodwill you might,<br>But surely, master, not a rag of money.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1383	1384	2	16	God and the rope-maker bear me witness<br>That I was sent for nothing but a rope.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1392	1393	2	16	And, gentle master, I received no gold.<br>But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1420	1420	1	9	Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	4	4	1422	1424	3	13	Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good<br>master.<br>Cry <span class="quote" data-words="2">The devil!</span>
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1742	1742	1	9	Sir, he dined with her there at the Porpentine.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1755	1757	3	26	Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,<br>But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords.<br>Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1759	1761	3	24	Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you,<br>For lately we were bound as you are now.<br>You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1770	1770	1	6	No, trust me, sir, nor I.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1772	1774	3	21	Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and<br>whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to<br>believe him.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1804	1804	1	8	I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1834	1834	1	4	And I with him.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1853	1853	1	4	No, none by me.
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1887	1889	3	26	Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother.<br>I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.<br>Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1891	1892	2	8	That’s a question. How shall we<br>try it?
DromioOfEphesus_Err	5	1	1895	1898	4	23	Nay, then, thus:<br>We came into the world like brother and brother,<br>And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before<br>another.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	1	2	175	176	2	17	Many a man would take you at your word<br>And go indeed, having so good a mean.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	400	400	1	9	What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	402	403	2	20	I did not see you since you sent me hence,<br>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	407	408	2	20	I am glad to see you in this merry vein.<br>What means this jest, I pray you, master, tell me?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	411	412	2	18	Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is earnest.<br>Upon what bargain do you give it me?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	422	427	6	52	<span class="quote" data-words="1">Sconce</span> call you it? So you<br>would leave battering, I had rather have it a<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">head.</span> An you use these blows long, I must get a<br>sconce for my head and ensconce it too, or else I<br>shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir,<br>why am I beaten?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	429	430	2	7	Nothing, sir, but that I am<br>beaten.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	432	433	2	12	Ay, sir, and wherefore, for they<br>say every why hath a wherefore.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	437	440	4	27	Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,<br>When in the <span class="quote" data-words="1">why</span> and the <span class="quote" data-words="1">wherefore</span> is neither<br>rhyme nor reason?<br>Well, sir, I thank you.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	442	443	2	11	Marry, sir, for this something<br>that you gave me for nothing.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	447	448	2	10	No, sir, I think the meat wants<br>that I have.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	451	451	1	1	Basting.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	453	454	2	11	If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of<br>it.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	456	457	2	11	Lest it make you choleric and<br>purchase me another dry basting.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	460	461	2	10	I durst have denied that before<br>you were so choleric.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	463	464	2	16	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as<br>the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	466	467	2	15	There’s no time for a man to<br>recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	470	471	2	16	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig,<br>and recover the lost hair of another man.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	474	476	3	24	Because it is a blessing that he<br>bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men<br>in hair, he hath given them in wit.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	479	480	2	14	Not a man of those but he hath<br>the wit to lose his hair.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	483	484	2	15	The plainer dealer, the sooner<br>lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	486	486	1	6	For two, and sound ones too.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	488	488	1	3	Sure ones, then.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	491	491	1	3	Certain ones, then.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	493	495	3	23	The one, to save the money that<br>he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they<br>should not drop in his porridge.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	498	499	2	14	Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en<br>no time to recover hair lost by nature.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	502	504	3	18	Thus I mend it: Time himself is<br>bald and therefore, to the world’s end, will have<br>bald followers.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	554	554	1	2	By me?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	560	560	1	9	I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	563	563	1	9	I never spake with her in all my life.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	586	590	5	47	O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.<br>This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!<br>We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.<br>If we obey them not, this will ensue:<br>They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	594	594	1	7	I am transformèd, master, am I not?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	596	596	1	9	Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	598	598	1	5	No, I am an ape.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	600	602	3	32	’Tis true. She rides me, and I long for grass.<br>’Tis so. I am an ass; else it could never be<br>But I should know her as well as she knows me.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	2	2	617	617	1	8	Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	662	668	7	41	Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!<br>Either get thee from the door or sit down at the<br>hatch.<br>Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for<br>such store<br>When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the<br>door.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	671	672	2	14	Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch<br>cold on ’s feet.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	674	675	2	11	Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me<br>wherefore.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	677	678	2	11	Nor today here you must not. Come again when you<br>may.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	681	682	2	11	The porter for this time, sir, and my name is<br>Dromio.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	699	700	2	12	If thy name be called <span class="quote" data-words="1">Luce,</span> Luce, thou hast<br>answered him well.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	703	703	1	4	And you said no.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	714	715	2	10	By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly<br>boys.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	735	736	2	10	Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s<br>pate.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	741	741	1	9	It seems thou want’st breaking. Out upon thee, hind!
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	1	744	745	2	11	Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no<br>fin.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	870	871	2	15	Do you know me, sir? Am I<br>Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	874	875	2	12	I am an ass, I am a woman’s<br>man, and besides myself.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	878	880	3	23	Marry, sir, besides myself I am<br>due to a woman, one that claims me, one that<br>haunts me, one that will have me.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	882	886	5	41	Marry, sir, such claim as you<br>would lay to your horse, and she would have me as<br>a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me,<br>but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays<br>claim to me.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	888	891	4	35	A very reverend body, ay, such a<br>one as a man may not speak of without he say<br><span class="quote" data-words="1">sir-reverence.</span> I have but lean luck in the match,<br>and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	894	900	7	62	Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen<br>wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to<br>put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from<br>her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the<br>tallow in them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives<br>till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the<br>whole world.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	902	904	3	26	Swart like my shoe, but her face<br>nothing like so clean kept. For why? She sweats. A<br>man may go overshoes in the grime of it.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	907	908	2	11	No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood<br>could not do it.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	910	912	3	22	Nell, sir, but her name and<br>three quarters—that’s an ell and three quarters—<br>will not measure her from hip to hip.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	915	917	3	24	No longer from head to foot than<br>from hip to hip. She is spherical, like a globe. I<br>could find out countries in her.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	920	921	2	12	Marry, sir, in her buttocks. I<br>found it out by the bogs.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	923	924	2	13	I found it by the barrenness,<br>hard in the palm of the hand.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	926	927	2	11	In her forehead, armed and<br>reverted, making war against her heir.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	929	932	4	32	I looked for the chalky cliffs, but<br>I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess it<br>stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran<br>between France and it.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	934	935	2	13	Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot<br>in her breath.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	937	941	5	33	O, sir, upon her nose, all o’erembellished<br>with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires,<br>declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of<br>Spain, who sent whole armadas of carracks to be<br>ballast at her nose.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	944	954	11	95	O, sir, I did not look so low. To<br>conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me,<br>called me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told<br>me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark<br>of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart<br>on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a<br>witch.<br>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of<br>faith, and my heart of steel,<br>She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made<br>me turn i’ th’ wheel.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	3	2	962	963	2	20	As from a bear a man would run for life,<br>So fly I from her that would be my wife.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	1	1081	1088	8	64	Master, there’s a bark of Epidamium<br>That stays but till her owner comes aboard,<br>And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,<br>I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought<br>The oil, the balsamum, and aqua vitae.<br>The ship is in her trim; the merry wind<br>Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all<br>But for their owner, master, and yourself.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	1	1091	1091	1	9	A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	1	1094	1095	2	19	You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.<br>You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	1	1105	1109	5	39	To Adriana. That is where we dined,<br>Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.<br>She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.<br>Thither I must, although against my will,<br>For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1141	1142	2	10	Here, go—the desk, the purse! Sweet, now make<br>haste.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1144	1144	1	3	By running fast.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1146	1157	12	77	No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.<br>A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,<br>One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel;<br>A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;<br>A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;<br>A backfriend, a shoulder clapper, one that<br>countermands<br>The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;<br>A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot<br>well,<br>One that before the judgment carries poor souls to<br>hell.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1159	1159	1	12	I do not know the matter. He is ’rested on the case.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1161	1165	5	35	I know not at whose suit he is arrested well,<br>But is in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I<br>tell.<br>Will you send him, mistress, redemption—the<br>money in his desk?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1169	1170	2	19	Not on a band, but on a stronger thing:<br>A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1172	1174	3	23	No, no, the bell. ’Tis time that I were gone.<br>It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes<br>one.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1176	1177	2	14	O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back<br>for very fear.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	2	1180	1186	7	58	Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s<br>worth to season.<br>Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say<br>That time comes stealing on by night and day?<br>If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the<br>way,<br>Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1202	1204	3	18	Master, here’s the gold you sent<br>me for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam<br>new-appareled?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1206	1210	5	43	Not that Adam that kept the<br>Paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison; he<br>that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the<br>Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil<br>angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1212	1218	7	63	No? Why, ’tis a plain case: he<br>that went like a bass viol in a case of leather; the<br>man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives<br>them a sob and ’rests them; he, sir, that takes pity<br>on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he<br>that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his<br>mace than a morris-pike.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1221	1224	4	35	Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;<br>he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his<br>band; one that thinks a man always going to bed<br>and says <span class="quote" data-words="5">God give you good rest.</span>
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1228	1232	5	41	Why, sir, I brought you word an<br>hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight,<br>and then were you hindered by the sergeant<br>to tarry for the hoy Delay. Here are the angels that<br>you sent for to deliver you.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1240	1240	1	5	Master, is this Mistress Satan?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1242	1248	8	71	Nay, she is worse; she is the<br>devil’s dam, and here she comes in the habit of a<br>light wench. And thereof comes that the wenches<br>say <span class="quote" data-words="3">God damn me</span>; that’s as much to say <span class="quote" data-words="6">Godmake me a light wench.</span> It is written they appear<br>to men like angels of light. Light is an effect of fire,<br>and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn.<br>Come not near her.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1252	1253	2	12	Master, if you do, expect spoon<br>meat, or bespeak a long spoon.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1255	1256	2	13	Marry, he must have a long<br>spoon that must eat with the devil.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1263	1267	5	51	Some devils ask but the parings<br>of one’s nail, a rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a<br>nut, a cherrystone; but she, more covetous, would<br>have a chain. Master, be wise. An if you give it her,<br>the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	3	1271	1272	2	9	<span class="quote" data-words="2">Fly pride,</span> says the peacock.<br>Mistress, that you know.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	4	1447	1447	1	10	She that would be your wife now ran from you.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	4	4	1450	1455	6	54	Faith, stay here this night. They<br>will surely do us no harm. You saw they speak us<br>fair, give us gold. Methinks they are such a gentle<br>nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that<br>claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to<br>stay here still, and turn witch.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1493	1494	2	18	Run, master, run. For God’s sake, take a house.<br>This is some priory. In, or we are spoiled.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1803	1803	1	7	I, sir, am Dromio. Command him away.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1806	1806	1	9	O, my old master.—Who hath bound him here?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1878	1878	1	8	Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1880	1880	1	10	Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1884	1886	3	26	There is a fat friend at your master’s house<br>That kitchened me for you today at dinner.<br>She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1890	1890	1	7	Not I, sir. You are my elder.
DromioOfSyracuse_Err	5	1	1893	1894	2	11	We’ll draw cuts for the signior.<br>Till then, lead thou first.
Duke_Err	1	1	121	123	3	26	And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br>Do me the favor to dilate at full<br>What have befall’n of them and thee till now.
Duke_Err	1	1	140	155	16	122	Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked<br>To bear the extremity of dire mishap,<br>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br>My soul should sue as advocate for thee.<br>But though thou art adjudgèd to the death,<br>And passèd sentence may not be recalled<br>But to our honor’s great disparagement,<br>Yet will I favor thee in what I can.<br>Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day<br>To seek thy life by beneficial help.<br>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br>And live. If no, then thou art doomed to die.—<br>Jailer, take him to thy custody.
Duke_Err	1	1	28	30	3	22	Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause<br>Why thou departedst from thy native home<br>And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.
Duke_Err	1	1	3	25	23	159	Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.<br>I am not partial to infringe our laws.<br>The enmity and discord which of late<br>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<br>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<br>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,<br>Have sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<br>Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.<br>For since the mortal and intestine jars<br>’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<br>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,<br>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<br>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.<br>Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus<br>Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;<br>Again, if any Syracusian born<br>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<br>His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,<br>Unless a thousand marks be levièd<br>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<br>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<br>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<br>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
Duke_Err	1	1	96	97	2	17	Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so,<br>For we may pity though not pardon thee.
Duke_Err	5	1	1591	1593	3	24	Yet once again proclaim it publicly,<br>If any friend will pay the sum for him,<br>He shall not die; so much we tender him.
Duke_Err	5	1	1595	1596	2	17	She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.<br>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
Duke_Err	5	1	1622	1628	7	60	Long since, thy husband served me in my wars,<br>And I to thee engaged a prince’s word,<br>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,<br>To do him all the grace and good I could.<br>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,<br>And bid the Lady Abbess come to me.<br>I will determine this before I stir.
Duke_Err	5	1	1647	1648	2	9	Come, stand by me. Fear nothing.—Guard with<br>halberds.
Duke_Err	5	1	1666	1666	1	8	Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
Duke_Err	5	1	1669	1669	1	8	A grievous fault.—Say, woman, didst thou so?
Duke_Err	5	1	1721	1721	1	10	But had he such a chain of thee or no?
Duke_Err	5	1	1734	1741	8	58	Why, what an intricate impeach is this!<br>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.<br>If here you housed him, here he would have been.<br>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.<br>You say he dined at home; the<br>goldsmith here<br>Denies that saying. Sirrah,<br>what say you?
Duke_Err	5	1	1745	1745	1	8	Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?
Duke_Err	5	1	1747	1748	2	23	Why, this is strange.—Go call the Abbess hither.<br>I think you are all mated or stark mad.
Duke_Err	5	1	1752	1752	1	6	Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
Duke_Err	5	1	1794	1797	4	28	I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years<br>Have I been patron to Antipholus,<br>During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa.<br>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
Duke_Err	5	1	1800	1802	3	25	One of these men is genius to the other.<br>And so, of these, which is the natural man<br>And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
Duke_Err	5	1	1814	1819	6	41	Why, here begins his morning story right:<br>These two Antipholus’, these two so like,<br>And these two Dromios, one in semblance—<br>Besides her urging of her wrack at sea—<br>These are the parents to these children,<br>Which accidentally are met together.
Duke_Err	5	1	1830	1830	1	6	Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first.
Duke_Err	5	1	1832	1832	1	9	Stay, stand apart. I know not which is which.
Duke_Err	5	1	1860	1860	1	9	It shall not need. Thy father hath his life.
Duke_Err	5	1	1877	1877	1	9	With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.
Egeon_Err	1	1	1	2	2	16	Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,<br>And by the doom of death end woes and all.
Egeon_Err	1	1	124	139	16	123	My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>At eighteen years became inquisitive<br>After his brother, and importuned me<br>That his attendant—so his case was like,<br>Reft of his brother, but retained his name—<br>Might bear him company in the quest of him,<br>Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,<br>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<br>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,<br>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,<br>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br>Or that or any place that harbors men.<br>But here must end the story of my life;<br>And happy were I in my timely death<br>Could all my travels warrant me they live.
Egeon_Err	1	1	157	158	2	12	Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,<br>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
Egeon_Err	1	1	26	27	2	17	Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,<br>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
Egeon_Err	1	1	31	95	65	489	A heavier task could not have been imposed<br>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;<br>Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,<br>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.<br>In Syracusa was I born, and wed<br>Unto a woman happy but for me,<br>And by me, had not our hap been bad.<br>With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased<br>By prosperous voyages I often made<br>To Epidamium, till my factor’s death<br>And the great care of goods at random left<br>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;<br>From whom my absence was not six months old<br>Before herself—almost at fainting under<br>The pleasing punishment that women bear—<br>Had made provision for her following me<br>And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.<br>There had she not been long but she became<br>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,<br>And, which was strange, the one so like the other<br>As could not be distinguished but by names.<br>That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,<br>A mean woman was deliverèd<br>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.<br>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,<br>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.<br>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br>Made daily motions for our home return.<br>Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon<br>We came aboard.<br>A league from Epidamium had we sailed<br>Before the always-wind-obeying deep<br>Gave any tragic instance of our harm;<br>But longer did we not retain much hope,<br>For what obscurèd light the heavens did grant<br>Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,<br>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br>That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br>And this it was, for other means was none:<br>The sailors sought for safety by our boat<br>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.<br>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,<br>Such as seafaring men provide for storms.<br>To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.<br>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,<br>Fastened ourselves at either end the mast<br>And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br>Dispersed those vapors that offended us,<br>And by the benefit of his wished light<br>The seas waxed calm, and we discoverèd<br>Two ships from far, making amain to us,<br>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.<br>But ere they came—O, let me say no more!<br>Gather the sequel by that went before.
Egeon_Err	1	1	98	120	23	183	O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br>Worthily termed them merciless to us.<br>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br>We were encountered by a mighty rock,<br>Which being violently borne upon,<br>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br>Fortune had left to both of us alike<br>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdenèd<br>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,<br>Was carried with more speed before the wind,<br>And in our sight they three were taken up<br>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>At length, another ship had seized on us<br>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,<br>And would have reft the fishers of their prey<br>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss,<br>That by misfortunes was my life prolonged<br>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1658	1659	2	16	Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,<br>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1749	1751	3	25	Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word.<br>Haply I see a friend will save my life<br>And pay the sum that may deliver me.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1753	1754	2	14	Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus?<br>And is not that your bondman Dromio?
Egeon_Err	5	1	1758	1758	1	9	I am sure you both of you remember me.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1762	1762	1	10	Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1764	1767	4	34	O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,<br>And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand<br>Have written strange defeatures in my face.<br>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
Egeon_Err	5	1	1769	1769	1	3	Dromio, nor thou?
Egeon_Err	5	1	1771	1771	1	5	I am sure thou dost.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1775	1786	12	94	Not know my voice! O time’s extremity,<br>Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue<br>In seven short years that here my only son<br>Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?<br>Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid<br>In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,<br>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,<br>Yet hath my night of life some memory,<br>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,<br>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.<br>All these old witnesses—I cannot err—<br>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1788	1790	3	22	But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,<br>Thou know’st we parted. But perhaps, my son,<br>Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.
Egeon_Err	5	1	1820	1822	3	25	If I dream not, thou art Emilia.<br>If thou art she, tell me, where is that son<br>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
Luce_Err	3	1	690	691	2	12	What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are those at the<br>gate?
Luce_Err	3	1	693	694	2	11	Faith, no, he comes too late,<br>And so tell your master.
Luce_Err	3	1	697	698	2	10	Have at you with another: that’s—When, can you<br>tell?
Luce_Err	3	1	702	702	1	6	I thought to have asked you.
Luce_Err	3	1	707	707	1	6	Can you tell for whose sake?
Luce_Err	3	1	709	709	1	6	Let him knock till it ache.
Luce_Err	3	1	711	712	2	12	What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the<br>town?
Luciana_Err	2	1	270	275	6	48	Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,<br>And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.<br>Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.<br>A man is master of his liberty;<br>Time is their master, and when they see time<br>They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
Luciana_Err	2	1	277	277	1	8	Because their business still lies out o’ door.
Luciana_Err	2	1	279	279	1	9	O, know he is the bridle of your will.
Luciana_Err	2	1	281	291	11	85	Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.<br>There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye<br>But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.<br>The beasts, the fishes, and the wingèd fowls<br>Are their males’ subjects and at their controls.<br>Man, more divine, the master of all these,<br>Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,<br>Endued with intellectual sense and souls,<br>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,<br>Are masters to their females, and their lords.<br>Then let your will attend on their accords.
Luciana_Err	2	1	293	293	1	8	Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
Luciana_Err	2	1	295	295	1	8	Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.
Luciana_Err	2	1	297	297	1	8	Till he come home again, I would forbear.
Luciana_Err	2	1	308	309	2	18	Well, I will marry one day, but to try.<br>Here comes your man. Now is your husband nigh.
Luciana_Err	2	1	317	318	2	10	Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel<br>his meaning?
Luciana_Err	2	1	339	339	1	2	Quoth who?
Luciana_Err	2	1	357	357	1	7	Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.
Luciana_Err	2	1	373	373	1	6	Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.
Luciana_Err	2	1	387	387	1	7	How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
Luciana_Err	2	2	550	552	3	27	Fie, brother, how the world is changed with you!<br>When were you wont to use my sister thus?<br>She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
Luciana_Err	2	2	585	585	1	8	Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
Luciana_Err	2	2	591	593	3	17	Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not?<br>Dromio—thou, Dromio—thou snail, thou slug,<br>thou sot.
Luciana_Err	2	2	599	599	1	10	If thou art changed to aught, ’tis to an ass.
Luciana_Err	2	2	619	619	1	7	Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
Luciana_Err	3	2	792	821	30	225	And may it be that you have quite forgot<br>A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,<br>Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?<br>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?<br>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,<br>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more<br>kindness.<br>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth —<br>Muffle your false love with some show of<br>blindness.<br>Let not my sister read it in your eye;<br>Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;<br>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;<br>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger.<br>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.<br>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.<br>Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?<br>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?<br>’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed<br>And let her read it in thy looks at board.<br>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managèd;<br>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.<br>Alas, poor women, make us but believe,<br>Being compact of credit, that you love us.<br>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;<br>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.<br>Then, gentle brother, get you in again.<br>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.<br>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain<br>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
Luciana_Err	3	2	846	846	1	9	What, are you mad that you do reason so?
Luciana_Err	3	2	848	848	1	9	It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
Luciana_Err	3	2	850	851	2	10	Gaze when you should, and that will clear your<br>sight.
Luciana_Err	3	2	853	853	1	9	Why call you me <span class="quote" data-words="1">love</span>? Call my sister so.
Luciana_Err	3	2	855	855	1	3	That’s my sister.
Luciana_Err	3	2	861	861	1	9	All this my sister is, or else should be.
Luciana_Err	3	2	866	867	2	14	O soft, sir. Hold you still.<br>I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1116	1116	1	9	First he denied you had in him no right.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1118	1118	1	9	Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1120	1120	1	5	Then pleaded I for you.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1122	1122	1	10	That love I begged for you he begged of me.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1124	1125	2	18	With words that in an honest suit might move.<br>First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1127	1127	1	4	Have patience, I beseech.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1134	1135	2	18	Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?<br>No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.
Luciana_Err	4	2	1143	1143	1	6	How hast thou lost thy breath?
Luciana_Err	4	4	1342	1342	1	8	Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
Luciana_Err	4	4	1382	1382	1	9	And I am witness with her that she did.
Luciana_Err	4	4	1402	1402	1	10	Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
Luciana_Err	4	4	1425	1425	1	9	God help poor souls! How idly do they talk!
Luciana_Err	4	4	1442	1442	1	8	God for Thy mercy, they are loose again!
Luciana_Err	5	1	1547	1550	4	22	She never reprehended him but mildly<br>When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and<br>wildly.—<br>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
Luciana_Err	5	1	1574	1574	1	7	Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
Luciana_Err	5	1	1590	1590	1	9	Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.
Luciana_Err	5	1	1673	1674	2	18	Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night<br>But she tells to your Highness simple truth.
Merchant1_Err	1	2	159	166	8	60	Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,<br>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br>This very day a Syracusian merchant<br>Is apprehended for arrival here<br>And, not being able to buy out his life,<br>According to the statute of the town<br>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br>There is your money that I had to keep.
Merchant1_Err	1	2	182	187	6	46	I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,<br>Of whom I hope to make much benefit.<br>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o’clock,<br>Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart<br>And afterward consort you till bedtime.<br>My present business calls me from you now.
Merchant1_Err	1	2	190	190	1	8	Sir, I commend you to your own content.
Merchant2_Err	4	1	1046	1046	1	9	The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch.
Merchant2_Err	4	1	1053	1055	3	23	My business cannot brook this dalliance.<br>Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no.<br>If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer.
Merchant2_Err	4	1	1063	1063	1	7	Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Merchant2_Err	4	1	995	1000	6	45	You know since Pentecost the sum is due,<br>And since I have not much importuned you,<br>Nor now I had not, but that I am bound<br>To Persia and want guilders for my voyage.<br>Therefore make present satisfaction,<br>Or I’ll attach you by this officer.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1461	1461	1	9	How is the man esteemed here in the city?
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1466	1466	1	8	Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1481	1481	1	9	Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1483	1485	3	25	These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee.<br>Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st<br>To walk where any honest men resort.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1489	1489	1	9	I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1500	1500	1	10	I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1579	1583	5	38	By this, I think, the dial points at five.<br>Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person<br>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,<br>The place of death and sorry execution<br>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1585	1588	4	25	To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,<br>Who put unluckily into this bay<br>Against the laws and statutes of this town,<br>Beheaded publicly for his offense.
Merchant2_Err	5	1	1724	1729	6	51	Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine<br>Heard you confess you had the chain of him<br>After you first forswore it on the mart,<br>And thereupon I drew my sword on you,<br>And then you fled into this abbey here,<br>From whence I think you are come by miracle.
Messenger_Err	5	1	1629	1639	11	85	O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself.<br>My master and his man are both broke loose,<br>Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,<br>Whose beard they have singed off with brands of<br>fire,<br>And ever as it blazed they threw on him<br>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.<br>My master preaches patience to him, and the while<br>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;<br>And sure, unless you send some present help,<br>Between them they will kill the conjurer.
Messenger_Err	5	1	1642	1646	5	47	Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.<br>I have not breathed almost since I did see it.<br>He cries for you and vows, if he can take you,<br>To scorch your face and to disfigure you.<br>Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, begone!
OFFICERS.Jailer_Err	1	1	156	156	1	4	I will, my lord.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	1	1008	1008	1	9	That labor may you save. See where he comes.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	1	1064	1065	2	12	I do, and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey<br>me.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	1	1074	1074	1	9	I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1308	1308	1	4	Good sir, be patient.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1311	1311	1	5	Good now, hold thy tongue.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1406	1407	2	14	Masters, let him go.<br>He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1412	1413	2	18	He is my prisoner. If I let him go,<br>The debt he owes will be required of me.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1429	1429	1	8	One Angelo, a goldsmith. Do you know him?
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1431	1431	1	3	Two hundred ducats.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1433	1433	1	9	Due for a chain your husband had of him.
OFFICERS.X.1_Err	4	4	1445	1445	1	4	Away! They’ll kill us.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1344	1344	1	10	Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1346	1349	4	33	I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,<br>To yield possession to my holy prayers,<br>And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.<br>I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1373	1374	2	17	It is no shame. The fellow finds his vein<br>And, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1385	1387	3	26	Mistress, both man and master is possessed.<br>I know it by their pale and deadly looks.<br>They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1401	1401	1	8	More company! The fiend is strong within him.
Pinch_Err	4	4	1408	1408	1	9	Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
